# GitLab's Security Controls

Security controls are a way to state our company's position on a variety of security topics. It's not enough to simply say "We encrypt data" since our customers and teams will naturally want to know "what data do we encrypt?" and "how do we encrypt that data?". When all of our established security controls are operating effectively this creates a security program greater than the sum of its parts. It demonstrates to our stakeholders that GitLab has a mature and comprehensive security program that will provide assurance that data within GitLab is reasonably protected.

## GitLab Control Framework (GCF)

We have tried to take a comprehensive approach to our immediate and future security compliance needs. Older and larger companies tend to treat each security compliance requirement individually which results in independent security compliance teams going out to internal teams with multiple overlapping requests. For example, at such a company you might have one database engineer that is asked to provide evidence of how a particular database is encrypted based on SOC2 requirements, then again for ISO requirements, then again for FedRAMP requirements. This approach can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    SOC2_Requirement1-->Team1;
    SOC2_Requirement1-->Team2;
    SOC2_Requirement2-->Team1;
    SOC2_Requirement2-->Team2;
    FedRAMP_Requirement1-->Team1;
    ISO_Requirement1-->Team2;
```

Given our [efficiency value](/handbook/values/#efficiency) here at GitLab we wanted to create a set of security controls that would address multiple underlying requirements with a single security control which would allow us to make fewer requests of our internal teams and efficiently collect all evidence we would need for a variety of audits at once. This approach can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    SOC2_Requirement1-->GCF;
    SOC2_Requirement2-->GCF;
    FedRAMP_Requirement1-->GCF;
    ISO_Requirement1-->GCF;
    GCF-->Team1;
    GCF-->Team2;
```

As our security compliance goals and requirements have evolved so have our requirements and constraints related to our security control framework. Our GCF is currently based on NIST SP 800-53.
## Security Control Lifecycle

The lifecycle of our security controls can be found at [this handbook page](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/security-control-lifecycle.html). As part of the security control lifecycle, all GCF security controls are reviewed and tested at a minimum on an annual basis or as required by regulation.

GCF security controls are assessed at the entity level or the system level depending upon the nature of the control. 

GCF security controls assessed at system level are based upon the system's [critical system tiering](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/critical-systems.html). Dependent upon the system's tier, a subset of GCF controls are evaluated based upon overall risk and impact to the organization. This is broken out as follows:
 

|Tier |	GCF Control Scope |	ZenGRC Link|
|--|--|--|
|Tier 1 Mission Critical|All "In-Scope" Controls| [Link](https://gitlab.zengrc.com/sor/listing/controls?p=eyJzb3IiOnsicGFnZVNpemUiOjIwMCwiY29sdW1ucyI6WyJ0aXRsZSIsInNsdWciLCJvd25lcnNHcm91cCIsImtleUNvbnRyb2wiLCJjYV9fMTE2IiwiY3JlYXRlZEF0IiwiZGVzY3JpcHRpb24iLCJzdGF0dXMiLCJjYV9fMTEyIiwibWFwcGluZ3MucHJvZ3JhbXMiLCJhc3Nlc3NtZW50cyJdLCJjb2x1bW5TaXplcyI6W3sibmFtZSI6InRlc3RQbGFuIiwic2l6ZSI6Mzc0fSx7Im5hbWUiOiJtYXBwaW5ncy5wcm9ncmFtcyIsInNpemUiOjM4MX1dLCJmaWx0ZXJzIjp7IkFORCI6W3siZiI6InN0YXR1cyIsIm8iOiI9IiwidiI6IkZpbmFsIn0seyJmIjoiY2FfXzExNiIsIm8iOiI9IiwidiI6IlN5c3RlbSJ9LHsiZiI6ImtleUNvbnRyb2wiLCJvIjoiPSIsInYiOiJLZXkifV19fX0%3D&page=1)|

## Control Ownership

Control Owner - Ensures that the design of the control and the control activities operate effectively and is responsible for remediation of any control activities that are required to bring that control into a state of audit-readiness.

Process Owner - Supports the operation of the control and carries out the process designed by the control owner. The process owner is most likely to be interviewed by an auditor to determine whether or not the process is operating as intended.

## Security Control Changes

The GitLab Security Compliance team is responsible for ensuring the consistency of the documentation of the security controls listed below. While normally we welcome any GitLab team member to make edits to handbook pages, please be aware that even small changes to the wording of any of these controls impacts how they satisfy the requirements for the security frameworks they map to. Because of this, we ask any changes that need to be made to this page and the underlying guidance pages to start with a message in the [#sec-assurance](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=sec-assurance) slack channel. The compliance team will then engage with you and make any appropriate changes to these handbook pages.

## GitLab IT General Controls (ITGCs) 

ITGCs are a subset of the GCF controls. Please refer to [GitLab SOX ITGC Compliance](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/finance/sox-internal-controls/) (internal only) for details.
