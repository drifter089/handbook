For GitLab's US-based team members, the FLSA determines which U.S. employees are exempt from the Act (not covered by it) and which are non-exempt (covered by the Act).

## Exempt Team Members

Team members who are based in the United States and classified as exempt employees are paid on a salary basis. This means the team member regularly receives a predetermined amount of compensation each pay period, which cannot be reduced because of variations in the quality or quantity of the team member's work. In general, a team member who is classified as an exempt employee will receive their salary for any week in which the team member performs any work, regardless of the number of days or hours worked. However, a team member classified as an exempt employee will not be paid for days not worked in the following circumstances:

* When a team member classified as an exempt employee takes one or more full days off for personal reasons other than sickness or disability, the team member will not be paid salary for such day(s) of absence, but will be able to use GitLab's Flexible PTO policy to make up for the reduction in salary. Team members who are classified as exempt employees must record absences from work for reasons such as sick leave, vacation, or other reasons set out in PTO by Roots to ensure that their time off is properly tracked and that they are paid according to the type of time off they are using.

* When a team member classified as an exempt employee only works part of the week during their first and last week with the Company, the team member will be paid only for the days actually worked.

* When a team member classified as an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act or corresponding laws, the team member will be asked to substitute GitLab's Sick Time policy, applicable short-term disability benefits, and/or State-paid disability to pay for the absence.

The salary of a team member classified as an exempt employee will not be reduced when the team member works part of a week and misses part of a week due to service as a juror, witness or in the military, though deductions may be made to offset amounts a team member receives as jury or witness fees, or for military pay. It is GitLab's policy to comply with the salary basis requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law. GitLab prohibits any deductions from pay that violate the FLSA or applicable state law.

If a team member classified as an exempt employee believes that an improper deduction has been made to their salary, the team member should immediately report this information to teammemberrelations@gitlab.com. Reports of imprioer deductions will be promptly investigated. If it is determined that an imprioer deduction as occurred, the team member will be promptly reimbursed for any improper deduction made.

## Non-Exempt Team Members

Team members who are based in the United States and classified as non-exempt employees must accurately record the time they work each day, including start time, end time, and meal break times. When team members receive their paychecks, they should verify immediately that their working time was recorded accurately and that they were paid correctly for all hours worked. Non-exempt employees are paid on a salary basis or hourly basis, as described below.

**Salary**: Non-exempt employees may be paid on a salary basis for a fixed number of hours or under the fluctuating workweek method. Salaried non-exempt employees must still receive overtime in accordance with federal and state laws.

**Hourly**: An individual who receives an hourly wage for work performed. Generally, hourly workers, because of the method of payment, are classified as non-exempt and are subject to the overtime provisions of the FLSA. 

# Overtime

When operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours, team members may be scheduled to work overtime. Paid time off such as sick pay, holiday pay, vacation pay and jury duty pay (where applicable) will not count toward hours worked for the purpose of determining overtime pay.

Non-exempt team members **must** report all time worked and not work any time that is not authorized by their managers. This means non-exempt team members **must not** start work early, finish work late, work during a meal or rest break, or perform any other extra or overtime work unless directed to do so. Team members who have questions about when or how many hours they are expected to work should contact their manager. If they have any additional concerns, they should reach out to Team Member Relations at `teammemberrelations@gitlab.com`.  

It is a violation of GitLab’s policy for anyone to instruct or encourage another team member to work “off the clock,” to incorrectly report hours worked, or to alter another team member’s time records. If any team member is directed or encouraged to incorrectly report hours worked, or to alter another team member’s time records, they should report the incident immediately to Team Member Relations at `teammemberrelations@gitlab.com`. 

GitLab **requires** manager approval prior to non-exempt team members working overtime. Unless a non-exempt team member resides in one of the below states, overtime is defined as working over 40 hours in a workweek, and results in a pay of 1.5x. A workweek is a Sunday to Saturday week.

| State  | Overtime Requirements        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Alaska        | 1.5x for over 8 hrs in any workday.           |
| California    | 1.5x for over 8 hrs up in any workday, and for the first 8 hrs on the 7th consecutive day of work in a workweek; 2x for over 12 hrs in any workday and over 8 hrs on the 7th consecutive day of a workweek |
| Colorado      | 1.5x for over 12 hrs in any workday, or over 40 hrs in a workweek, whichever equals greater wages.       |
| Rhode Island  | 1.5x for any hours worked on a Sunday or on certain holidays.   |

## Overtime Approvals

**All overtime work must be authorized in advance by the team member’s manager**. To request overtime, team members will submit an email to their manager with the following information, prior to working the overtime:

- Date of overtime requested
- Estimated number of hours
- Explanation why the work cannot be completed during regular working hours

*Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary action*. It is the manager's responsibility to review timecards. If overtime is submitted without prior authorization, please communicate with your direct report to better understand what happened, and to reiterate our overtime approvals policy. Review additional questions in our [Frequently Asked Questions](/handbook/finance/timekeeping/frequently-asked-questions/) page.

## Overtime Pay Calculation

### All US States (Other than AK, CA, CO, RI)

For all states other than those listed in the Overtime Requirements table above, overtime pay will be calculated at a rate of 1.5 times the team member’s normal hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. For the other four US states, please refer to the Overtime Requirements table for those specific calculations. Please note that only **hours worked** count towards the overtime threshold. Paid time off such as PTO and Jury Duty do not count as time worked for overtime purposes.

**Example 1:** A team member is paid $1,000.00 per pay period for a 80-hour bi-weekly pay period. Normal hourly rate = $12.50 per hour. Overtime rate = $12.50 * 1.5 = $18.75 per hour. A team member that works a total of 43 hours in one week would be paid as follows:

|Hours| Rate| Total|
|------|-----|-------|
|40 hrs Regular| $12.50/hr|$500.00|
|3 hrs Overtime|$18.75/hr|$56.25|
|      |Total for the week|$556.25|    

**Example 2:** A team member worked 35 hours in a week and used 8 hours of PTO in the same week. The team member would be paid for that week as follows:

|Hours| Rate| Total|
|------|-----|-------|
|35 hrs Regular| $12.50/hr|$437.50|
|8 hrs PTO|$12.50/hr|$100.00|
|      |Total for the week|$537.50| 

Overtime pay will be included in the payroll for the pay period in which the time is worked. Please review and bookmark the pay periods and pay dates for the [US bi-weekly payroll schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15O3DAOXE2ENVHL4e9QSGulALDQ0tPT-FO4x9z1GufFU/edit#gid=0). 

**Please note, if someone does not submit a timecard in time, the overtime will be calculated and included in the following pay statement.**

## Commissions

Commissions for US team members are paid once a month through Payroll. Commissions are calculated in the same manner whether the team member is paid on a bi-weekly or semi-monthly schedule. For details on how commissions are calculated, contact the commissions team in Slack at `#commissions-and-xactly-incent-support`.

The commission information is typically received by Payroll between the 8th and the 10th of the month. Commission payments are included in the payroll in which the receipt date falls. Commissions will generally be included in the payroll whose cutoff date is the 10th of the month or later. In the event that the payroll cutoff is earlier than the 10th of the month and the commissions are received by or before that date, the commissions will be paid in the current pay period. Commissions will be paid in the same manner as regular pay - via direct deposit to the bank account on file in ADP.

### True-Up for Commissions

Commissions are considered part of the regular rate of pay for purposes of calculating overtime. Non-exempt team members that receive commissions will receive an overtime pay true-up once their commissions earnings information for the prior month is received by Payroll. Any overtime true-up due will be paid in the same payroll as the commissions. Please note that the overtime true-up will only be paid to non-exempt team members that earned commissions **and** received overtime pay in the prior month.

**Example 1:** There were 2 payrolls in the prior month - 160 regular hours. A team member worked 5 hours of overtime in that month and is due $1,000 in commissions. Their normal hourly rate is $12.50 per hour. During the regular payrolls of the month the team member received:

|Hours| Rate| Total|
|------|-----|-------|
|160 hrs Regular| $12.50/hr|$2,000.00|
|5 hrs Overtime|$18.75/hr|$93.75|
|      |Total for the month|$2,093.75| 

Overtime pay true-up calculation:

* Regular rate of pay: 165 hours (total hours in the month) * $12.50 per hour = $2,062.50
* Commissions:  $1,000.00
* Total earnings to include in regular rate of pay = $3,062.50
* Total earnings to include in regular rate of pay = $3,062.50
* Total hours worked in prior month = 165 hours
* Adjusted regular rate of pay = $18.56 ($3,062.50/165 hours)
* Adjusted overtime rate = $27.84 ($18.56 * 1.5)
* Total overtime due for the month = $27.84 * 5 hours = $139.20
* Less overtime pay received during the month = $93.75
* Overtime true-up due = $45.45 ($139.20 - $93.75)

# Meal and Rest Breaks

Breaks are an important part of your day. At GitLab, your well-being is critical. For your mental and physical health, please take at least the minimum listed breaks as listed below and **always** log your unpaid meal breaks. This is to ensure that we adhere to the United States labor laws.  It is GitLab’s policy to comply with **all** laws regarding meal and rest breaks. 

As a fully distributed company, any team member classified as a non-exempt employee is responsible for taking active ownership in ensuring they take the proper breaks. Please contact the Team Member Relations team at `teammemberrelations@gitlab.com` if you feel that your circumstances are preventing you from doing so. Review additional questions in our [Frequently Asked Questions](/handbook/finance/timekeeping/frequently-asked-questions/) page.

## Meal Break Policy

* Team members **must** clock in and out for meal periods in their Timekeeping portal in ADP.
* Team members who work between five and six hours a day are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes.
* Team members who work more than six hours a day are entitled to an unpaid meal break of at least 45 minutes.
* The meal period must begin no later than the end of a team member's fourth hour of work.
* A second unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes is due after 10 hours total worked in a single day.
* Team members should be completely relieved of duty during their meal break, and team members are never allowed to work through their meal breaks to make up hours.
* To the extent that the local law of the jurisdiction where the team member resides entitles a team member to longer breaks or breaks more often than as is set out in this policy, the local law applies.

## Rest Break Policy

* Team members **do not** log their rest breaks in their Timekeeping portal in ADP.
* Team members who work for at least two hours are entitled to one paid rest break of at least 10 minutes, and additional paid 10-minute rest breaks for every three and a half hours worked thereafter.
* Team members may not work more than three continuous hours without a rest break.

# ADP Time & Attendance Portal

GitLab, Inc. and GitLab Federal LLC use ADP Essential Time & Attendance to report the hours worked and time off for non-exempt team members in the US. ADP Essential Time & Attendance is included within ADP Workforce Now, which is accessed through Okta SSO. Review additional questions in our [Frequently Asked Questions](/handbook/finance/timekeeping/frequently-asked-questions/) page.

## Timecard Reporting

**All time worked and time off should be recorded promptly in your timesheet in ADP Essential Time & Attendance**. Instructions for team members on how to enter time into the timesheet can be found in our **GitLab Non-Exempt & Time and Attendance Training for Team Members**. **LINK to LevelUp TBA**

All timesheets should be completed, approved by the manager, and submitted to Payroll by **Noon Eastern** on the Monday *following* the end of a pay period. In the event that such a day falls on a holiday, timesheets will be due by **9am Eastern** on the Tuesday *after* the holiday. At the due date and time, all timesheets will be locked for payroll processing, and no further changes will be accepted. Any corrections needed after the due date and time should be promptly reported to Payroll by sending an email to `uspayroll@gitlab.com`. 

## Timecard Approval by Managers

As a manager, it is your responsibility to approve timecards. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action. Additionally, managers can be individually liable should an employee claim they have not been paid properly.Please review our instructions on how to access ADP Essential Time & Attendance and how to approve timesheets by completing our **GitLab Non-Exempt & Time and Attendance Training for Managers**. **LINK to LevelUp TBA** 

## Pay Schedule

Non-exempt team members in the US are paid on a bi-weekly basis (every two weeks). Please review the [US Bi-Weekly Pay Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15O3DAOXE2ENVHL4e9QSGulALDQ0tPT-FO4x9z1GufFU/edit?usp=sharing) for all pay periods, timesheet due dates, and pay dates. Payroll will send out a reminder email to all non-exempt US team members and their managers on the Friday at the end of each time periods, in preparation for the Monday submission and approval deadlines.

**Payday is every other Friday**, as listed in the US Bi-Weekly Pay Schedule. In the event that a pay day falls on a bank holiday, direct deposits will be paid the day before the holiday.

Pay for non-exempt team members in the US is calculated 6 days in arrears to allow time for processing. For example, for period 2023-08-13 to 2023-08-26, payment will be direct deposited on 2023-09-01.
