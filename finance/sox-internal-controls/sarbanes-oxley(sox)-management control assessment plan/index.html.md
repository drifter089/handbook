GitLab has adopted the COSO 2013 framework to support its evaluation/assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.


### Approach to evaluation

#### 1.  Assessing the entity-level control framework

This includes evaluating the effectiveness of GitLab’s entity-wide controls particularly relating to the control environment, risk assessment, and monitoring components of COSO. Below are the key control factors considered while evaluating COSO components at an entity level.

`Control Environment`

The control environment sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the foundation for all components of internal control, providing discipline and structure. The control environment encompasses several control factors, including:

*  Integrity and Ethical Values
*  Commitment to Competence
*  Board of Directors or Audit Committee
*  Management’s Philosophy and Operating Style
*  Organizational Structure
*  Assignment of Authority and Responsibility
*  Human Resource Policies and Procedures

`Risk Assessment`

Control factors to be considered while evaluating this component include: 

*  Definition of established objectives at both the strategic (entity-wide) level and the process (activity) level.
*  Identification of relevant internal and external risk factors that could impact the achievement of the defined objectives.
*  Mechanisms in place to continually re-assess risk and react to changing environments.


`Monitoring`

In the evaluation of the monitoring component the following factors are considered:

*  Extent of evidence obtained to support evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control.
*  Management responsiveness to recommendations on strengthening internal controls.
*  Effectiveness of internal audit activities.



#### 2.  Assessing process-level controls

Assessing process-level controls will include an evaluation of control design and an evaluation of control operation effectiveness.

**a.  Evaluating design effectiveness of controls**

Design effectiveness refers to whether the control is suitably designed to prevent or detect material misstatements in financial statements. It involves consideration of the financial reporting objectives that the control is meant to achieve and whether it will achieve them. When evaluating control design, the following factors are considered:

*  Whether the control achieves the financial reporting objective.
*  How the control is performed.
*  The frequency with which the control is performed.
*  The competence and experience of individuals involved in the process and executing the control.
*  The nature and size of misstatement that the control is likely to detect.
*  Follow-up activity on exceptions identified by the control.


The risk and control matrices, together with a listing of control gaps or deficiencies, will serve as evidence of this evaluation. If the design of a particular control is deemed to be inadequate or a control gap is identified, process/control owners will implement additional controls or changes in the design of existing controls. To maintain evaluation of design effectiveness current, process/control owners will review process, risk and control documentation at quarterly intervals to identify any new or changed risks and highlight the relevant controls that have been implemented to mitigate these risks.

**b.  Evaluating operating effectiveness of controls**

Operating effectiveness refers to whether the control is functioning as designed. During the evaluation of operating effectiveness, evidence regarding how the control was applied, the consistency with which it was applied, and by whom it was applied will be gathered.
SOX PMO will execute testing procedures to support management’s evaluation of operating effectiveness of controls for in-scope processes.

Prior to performing test work on the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, audit programs will be prepared. The audit program will set out the nature, timing and extent of the procedures to be performed.

**i.  Selection of test type and control categories**

Test Type: Techniques that may be used to obtain evidence about the effectiveness of the operation of controls include observation, inquiry, inspection, re-performance, knowledge assessment, corroborative inquiry, and system query. 

To determine the appropriate testing technique, it is first necessary to identify the control category. Controls can generally be categorized into the following:

Presentation to be added...........

For controls not falling into the control categories listed above, testing procedures will be determined based on the distinct nature of the control.

**ii.  Extent of Testing (Sample Sizes)**


Monitoring or manual controls: The sample size will depend on the frequency at which the control occurs. Testing standards are as follows:

| Frequency of Control | Baseline Sample Size |
| ------ | ------ |
| Annual | 1 |
| Semi-annual | 1 |
| Quarterly | 2 |
| Monthly | 3 |
| Fortnight | 5 |
| Weekly | 5 |
| Daily / Recurring (multiple times per day)| 25 |

Automated or IT control is applied to every transaction: Testing will generally be minimal as management will have tested general computer controls to be satisfied that they are functioning appropriately. Therefore, system query will often be the most appropriate testing technique. In this technique, one query as a test is appropriate for an IT system that would be expected to operate consistently in a well-controlled environment. A well-controlled environment is one where the specific configuration, interfaces and system access are appropriately designed and subject to appropriate change control procedures. Observation should also be made to ascertain whether there is any violation to the security access such as sharing of passwords.

Samples should be selected randomly to reflect an appropriate representation of the population. The specific sources and populations used for making sample selections will vary from control to control. Determining the appropriate source and population is a matter of judgment and should consider the following:

*  	Pervasiveness of the control and variety of instances in which the control is applied or by whom the control is applied.
*  	Changes in key personnel who perform the control or monitor its performance.
*  	Consistency with which the control is applied, i.e., sample sources and populations should cover an amount of time that will allow management to conclude on the consistency with which the control was applied.
*  	Quantitative measures for selecting high-value items.

The above guidance on the extent of testing applies in situations where there is a population to sample from. Controls may also exist where testing techniques and sample sizes may not be applicable. For example:

*  In situations where the knowledge assessment technique is used, the extent of testing should be sufficient to provide comfort regarding the knowledge of that one individual.
*  In situations where corroborative inquiry is used, the extent of testing should be sufficient to confirm consistency in the application of the control.

Rationale for determining sample selection sources and populations will be documented in the working papers, as appropriate.

**iii.  Timing of Testing**

Test of controls should be performed over a period of time that is adequate to determine whether, as of the date specified in the assertion, the controls necessary for achieving the objectives of the control criteria are operating effectively. The period of time over which tests of controls should be performed is a matter of management judgment.

If controls are to be tested over a period of time such as at an interim date using techniques other than knowledge assessment or corroborative inquiry (i.e., inspection, observation, re-performance), management should consider what additional evidence concerning the operation of the control should be obtained for the remaining period.

Evidence should be obtained about the nature and extent of any significant changes in internal control that occur subsequent to the previous or interim date through, for example, inquiry or observation. In addition, sufficient evidence should be obtained about the operating effectiveness of such controls since the previous or interim date, for example, by obtaining evidence about the operating effectiveness of the company’s monitoring of controls.

Prior to the date specified in the assertion, management may change the company’s controls to make them more effective or efficient, or to address control deficiencies. In these circumstances, controls that have been superseded may not need to be considered. For example, if management asserts that the new controls achieve the related objectives of the control criteria and have been in effect for a sufficient period and there is sufficient time to permit the testing of the new design and operating effectiveness, tests may not need to be performed on the design and operating effectiveness of the superseded controls, except to the extent of communicating identified significant deficiencies in controls that might have been identified in an interim period.

Management will prepare a detailed timeline for evaluation of control design and control effectiveness, as well as timelines to address control deficiencies and update control documentation.

**iv.  Documentation of Test Results**

In evaluating and developing the assessment of internal control over financial reporting, the evidential matter needs to be maintained to provide reasonable support in the review of management’s assessment and attestation conducted by the independent auditor. This evidential matter must provide sufficient documentation to enable the external auditor to conclude that there is a reasonable basis for the assertion on internal control over financial reporting that will be made by management.

Working papers will be prepared and crossed referenced to enable reviewers and external auditors to easily locate the documentation that supports the conclusion reached on the assessment of the selected internal controls over financial reporting. Working papers will include sufficient documentation to re-perform control testing (i.e., copies of sample documents tested) and will include supporting documentation for all testing exceptions.

**v.  Categorization and Escalation of Issues and Remediation**

When performing tests of operating effectiveness, management may find exceptions from prescribed control policies or procedures, as we do not expect controls to operate perfectly. In these instances, the nature and cause of the conditions must be investigated. Management is responsible for determining if a mitigating control compensates for the defective control and if that control is designed to achieve the same control objective. If the compensating control is appropriately designed, tests of operating effectiveness will then be performed on the compensating control.

When control testing exceptions are identified, the following steps will be taken:

*  The exception will be recorded in a repository of findings. The repository of findings will include the testing observation, control theme, potential implications, short-term and long-term action plans, the potential impact of the weakness and identification of mitigating controls. Maintenance of the repository will be the responsibility of the project leader.
*  The exception will be brought to the attention of a “Resolution Team” which will include the process owner and appropriate management, including the project leader. The responsibility to determine whether a deficiency is a significant deficiency or a material weakness lies with management.

Deficiencies can range from inconsequential, to significant, to material weaknesses. In limited situations, there may be sufficient evidence to conclude that the error was an isolated incident. If this is the case, it may still be possible to conclude that the control is operating effectively. Management will assess whether deficiencies, either individually or in the aggregate, rise to the level of a significant deficiency or a material weakness. According to the [PCAOB](https://pcaobus.org/) Final Ruling, significant deficiencies and material weaknesses are defined as follows:

*  **Significant deficiency**: A control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the company’s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process and report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected.
*  **Material weakness**: A significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

Deciding whether an internal control deficiency is a significant deficiency or material weakness requires both a detailed understanding by the management of the relevant facts and circumstances and a considerable amount of management judgment. Management will evaluate and formally document its assessment of the significance of a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting by determining the following:

*  	The likelihood that a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, could result in a misstatement of an account balance or disclosure.
*  	The magnitude of potential misstatement resulting from the deficiency or deficiencies.

When corrective action is taken to remedy a control deficiency, the corrected control should be in place and operating for a sufficient period of time prior to the assertion date for management to evaluate the corrected control and conclude that the control is operating effectively as of the assertion date. In addition, management will allow sufficient time to test the operating effectiveness of the control. Management will provide a rationale as to why a significant deficiency was not corrected or did not preclude them from concluding that the internal controls over financial reporting were operating effectively.
