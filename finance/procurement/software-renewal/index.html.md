## <i class="far fa-clock" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> How Do I Renew My Software Agreement and/or Add Licenses to it?
An enterprise contract is needed from the vendor to renew a software agreement and/or add additional licenses to an existing agreement. 
In instances when an enterprise agreement isn’t available, the online terms and conditions can be reviewed for approval if deemed acceptable for GitLab during the legal review phase.
Do NOT agree to ANY business, legal, and or pricing prior to engaging the procurement team. 
This ensures alignment across the multiple functions to make good-faith commitments to vendors and don’t put our company in to possible risk.
All software renewals and add-ons must have an approved purchase request (LINK to “How do I start the process”) in Coupa before the vendor can be paid.
Once the Coupa Purchase Request is approved, a Purchase Order (PO) is generated. This is an order number that is sent to the vendor’s billing team. 
The vendor must reference this PO number on their invoice to GitLab.
Contracts can only be signed after the Coupa purchase request is approved and may only be signed by the authorized parties in the Finance function. (LINK to auth matrix)
Only stamped by Legal contracts can be routed for signatures.
The procurement team will route the contract for signature at the “Contract Routing” approval step.
The Coupa req creator will be copied on the email to the vendor when the signed contract is sent.

HOW DO I START THE PROCESS?
Login to Coupa via Okta 
If you need support with login, please ping #coupa-help in slack.
Create Coupa Renewal Form: “Software Renewal/Addition” (DRI: Business Owner)
Be prepared to share the following in the Coupa Renewal form:
Current usage (e.g. number of users, projects, API's, etc.)
Anticipated usage for next 12 months (e.g. flat, growing or decreasing usage by 20 users, etc.)
Satisfaction with services (scale of 1 (poor) - 10 (exceptional)) and why.
Estimated budget
Need By (Renewal) Date
Requests without this form will be rejected until the form is added. 
If you need support opening or completing your Coupa form, tag us in slack at #procurement.
Once completed, a Coupa Purchase Request is automatically generated (DRI: Business Owner)
Be prepared to populate the following in the Coupa Purchase Request:
Vendor’s Main Contact Email address
Whether or not the software will have access to red and/or orange data (LINK: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/data-classification-standard.html#data-classification-levels) (incomplete info here will delay security review)
The data and systems the vendor will have access to (incomplete info here will delay security review)
Vendor’s Security Contact Email (oftentimes this is different from the main contact. Providing the head of security contact info from the vendor’s company will expedite the security review and avoid delays)
Once submitted, Procurement will review all reqs within 1-2 business days. 
If no further action or clarification is needed in the req, Procurement will approve - advancing the req will advance to the next approver as identified in Coupa.
If the contract requires negotiation (LINK TO BELOW), the req will stay in “Pending Buyer Action” status while the procurement team works a-sync in the Coupa req, and/or schedules a meeting to review the goals of the renewal/addition.

HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET MY RENEWAL APPROVED and SIGNED?
All contracts greater than $25K will be negotiated by the procurement team. The negotiation cycle typically takes 1-3 weeks based on the scope of the request. Large and/or complex contracts can take longer to negotiate.
Procurement will open software renewal reqs greater than $25K two months in advance of the renewal due date to begin the review and negotiation phase. 
If Procurement has not created a Req for a renewal you need for any reason, please create or Req or ping us in Slack at #procurement.
Contract renewal dates are stored here LINK. 
If you have a software contract that is not listed here or has incorrect information listed, please add/correct it in a comment directly in the link above.
All software contracts need multiple approvals including fp&a, security, legal, procurement, and functional leaders who each have their own SLA’s. 
The specific approvals are automated within the Coupa Purchase Request based on your spend type, contract amount, and risk to GitLab. 
This ensures that GitLab purchases are strategically aligned, and SOX Compliant.
You can help expedite approvals by completing all fields in the Coupa Request with as much information as possible. If additional information is needed, SLA’s get delayed.
WHAT IF I HAVE AN URGENT REQUEST?
Urgent requests that need approval in less than one week, need to be tagged in the #procurement channel for expediting.
Include a link to your urgent Coupa Request (LINK to How do I start the process?), identify the date needed, and specific impact to the business if this deadline is missed.
Urgent requests will be reviewed and evaluated. 
We may or may not be able to accommodate all urgent requests based on the risk and bandwidth necessary. 
Status will be communicated directly to your slack message.
