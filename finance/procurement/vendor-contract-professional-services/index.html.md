## Contract Request Capacity & Back Log

All open contract issue requests, are located at the [Procurement Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/boards/1844091)

In the event you have an issue that hasn't received a prompt response from procurement, requestor should mention Aleshia Hansen in the #procurement Slack channel and provide:

1. Link to the Vendor Contract Approval issue; and 
1. Timeline

In the event the procurement team is out of office (as highlighted in PTO calendar or Slack), and the matter is time sensitive, requestor should
contact #legal channel in Slack and provide:

1.  Link to Vendor Contract Approval Issue; and
2.  Reason for escalation, with timeline for requirement(s)

Legal will assign a team member to approve the procurement portion of the issue.
