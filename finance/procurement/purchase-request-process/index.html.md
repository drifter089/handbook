## Purchase request process

Start working with the Procurement team by opening a vendor contract approval issue based on the type of purchase below. Procurement will not approve the request if the request is incomplete and/or missing information.

Contact Procurement directly in Slack via #procurement if you have questions.

**Note: Before sharing details and/or confidential information regarding our business needs, please obtain a [Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement](https://drive.google.com/a/gitlab.com/file/d/1hRAMBYrYcd9yG8FOItsfN0XYgdp32ajt/view?usp=sharing) from the potential vendor(s).**

## Purchase types quick links

#### [**Software/SaaS**](/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-contract-saas/)

- Read more about this purchase type BEFORE agreeing to business terms and/or pricing.
- It is preferred we negotiate the best pricing up front to keep our ongoing costs to a minimum across our long-term relationships with vendors. We also continue to evaluate supplier pricing at the time of renewal to minimize our ongoing costs across our long-term relationships with vendors.


#### [**Field Marketing and Events**](/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-contract-marketing/)

- Examples for this template type include marketing events, programs, sponsorships, catering, hotels, swag and services that do NOT involve the processing or sharing of data.
- Due to the rapid nature of these types of requests, procurement will only negotiate if spend is greater then $100K and there is business justification and alignment to do so.
- If you will be sharing confidential data with the vendor, please use the template under Purchase Type #2 above.

#### [**Professional Services and all other contracts**](/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-contract-professional-services/)

- Read more about this purchase type BEFORE agreeing to business terms and/or pricing.
- This process can be used for addendums that either do or do not change pricing.
