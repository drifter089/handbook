## Home Office Equipment and Supplies

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Home Office Items

Prior to your start date, you will [work with GitLab IT to acquire a laptop](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops). For US team members, along with being able to order your laptop through GitLab, you will also have the option to order several other pieces of office hardware at the same time, such as monitor, keyboard, mouse, charger, webcam, laptop stand, adapter, and ergonomic desk & chair. You are not required to procure these items through GitLab, but, if these items fit your needs, we suggest choosing from our preselected catalogue because this is an easy option and will be billed directly to GitLab.

If you prefer to choose your own office equipment, are not located in the US, and/or cannot find some items that you may need in the catalogue, please referece the following list of common items for your home office at GitLab. It is uncommon to need all of the items listed below. Read [GitLab's guide to a productive home office or remote workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/), and use your best judgement and buy them as you need them.

#### Expensing hardware and supplies outside of the US

**The prices in the table below can serve as reference for team members as you look into purchasing new equipment. As an all-remote global company, prices might vary per region depending on taxes, tariffs and other factors. When making a spend above $100 USD, we encourage team members to look into 2 or 3 different providers and compare prices before acquiring new equipment.** 

**For non-US team members: if the product cost is higher in your location, confirm that an equivalent product in the United States would be close to the guideline price in the table below. In the event there are additional taxes or other fees in your region, please note this cost increase when submitting an expense report to ensure an efficient and speedy approval and reimbursement from our third party accounting team.**

Some team members prefer a single ultrawide monitor over multiple monitors.                                                                                      |

For those who interface routinely with clients, leads, and external parties, you may also consider a pricier mirrorless or DSLR camera as a webcam. |

You can also choose to extending your home network to your workspace by using a network extender.                                                                                                                    |

| Ethernet connector                               | $20                                  | 6/10       | This is if you choose to connect to your internet directly versus by Wi-Fi.
