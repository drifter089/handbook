## General Information

[Adaptive Insights](https://www.adaptiveplanning.com/), a Workday company, is a cloud-based corporate performance management platform. The GitLab FP&A team utilizes Adaptive Inisghts to plan, budget, and forecast GitLab's planning cycles. 

## Administration

#### Versioning 

One of the most powerful features of Adaptive Insights is versioning. Adminstrators can create, edit, and lock versions of a plan. 

##### GitLab Version Nomenclature

Each version of GitLab should specify the fiscal year and label of the plan / forecast. Below is a few examples of the nomenclature used at GitLab

- `FY21 - 0 + 12 Plan`
- `FY21 - 1 + 11 Forecast`
- `FY 21 - 2 + 10 Forecast`

#### Roles

There are currently five different roles within GitLab's Adaptive Insights instance

1. Administrative - full control of Adaptive Insights
1. Analysis - can access sheets, reports, dashboards, and process trackers. Analysis can also share reports and complete tasks using the process tracker. 
1. IT Administrator - full control of Adaptive Insights with the exception to salary details
1. Report Only - same as Analysis but can upload files for reporting
1. Standard - full control of Adaptive Insights with the exception to edit, modify or change structure. Standard also does not have admin or integration access

#### Users

Within Adpative, the administrator can assign a name, position, user name, home page, time zone, country, role, and level(s) for each user. The adminstrator can also reset the password, if needed, for the User. Users should use Okta to sign into Adaptive Insights but keep their password in One Password when assigned one. 

If you need access to Adaptive Insights, please open an [access request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests) and assign to the code owner of this page.

#### Report Structure 

The below image shows the current report structure in Adpative Insights. There are six main folders within the structure. The folders labeled `Annual Reports`, `Monthly Reports`,`Quarterly Reports`, and `YTD Reports` are considered production reports and should recieve sign off from the VP, Finance before moving to one of these folders. Before a report is considered production ready, a user must start a report in the `Sandbox Reports` folder, then get approval by the VP, Finance befor it can be moved into on of the production ready Reporting folders. Once sign off is approved, a user should ask an Adaptive Insights administrator to move the folder from Sandbox to the production ready folder. 

1. Annual Reports - folder that houses annual reports  
1. Implementation Requirements - folder that houses any requirements 
1. Monthly Reports - folder that houses monthly reports 
1. Quarterly Reports - folder that houses quarterly reports 
1. Sandbox Reports - folder that houses work in progress reports and where reports are created before moving to production
1. YTD Reports - folder that houses year to date reports
