## Greenhouse HC Approval SLA (Service Level Agreement)
We approve all new HC reqs (complete and error-free) by EOD business day or within 24 hours, whichever is the latter. Please notify us at least 48 hours in advance for any urgent requests (otherwise, thank you for your patience and partnership).

## Sales Forecast Rhythm
We believe an excellent forecasting process enables us to deploy our resources effectively, risk-manage the business, and provide early warning systems. At GitLab, we design our Sales Forecast Rhythm to foster careful inspection and execution of bookings target throughout the quarter. Each week we review various aspects of the business, such as Current/Next Quarter pipeline, Renewals timing, and leading indicators KPIs, to name but a few.

**Pipeline Velocity** - This file details how much Net ARR has been closed relative to the quarterly target and the pace it has been booked at throughout the quarter.  The current quarter performance is compared to other historical quarters, to highlight whether the speed at which the Net ARR has been closed is ahead or behind that of historical performance. In addition, the file also analyses how open pipeline is progressing for the next quarter relative to its quarterly target and the pace at which new opportunities are being added. This is 
also compared to historical quarters to inform whether the current quarter is ahead, in line, or behind the pace of previous quarters.
