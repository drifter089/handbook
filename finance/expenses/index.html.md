## <i class="far fa-paper-plane" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Introduction

Welcome to the Expenses page! You should be able to find answers to most of your questions here. If you can't find what you are looking for, then:

- **Email**: `expenses@gitlab.com`
- [**FAQ Document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5YmkJCOu5vNRbVdgVf1CaXdqgo8VDk1-MGLKcBkOAI/edit?usp=sharing)

GitLab utilizes Expensify as our team member expense reimbursement tool. All team members will have access to Expensify within 2 days from their hire date. If you didn't receive an email from Expensify for your access, please contact the AP team through one of the channels listed above.
**Note**: Ensure to opt-out from news by logging in and navigating to `Settings > Preferences > Contact Preferences` and un-checking the box at `Relevant feature updates and Expensify news`.

Some entities also use Tipalti for reimbursement. If you are in BV, Ireland, GmbH, GK or PTY Ltd you will also receive an invite from Tipalti to set up your banking details.

Expense reports are to be submitted at least once a month and must be submitted within 90 days of the invoice date, service date or purchase date. Additional information on getting started with Expensify and creating/submitting expense reports can be found [here](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5922/deep-dive-day-1-with-expensify-for-submitters/p1?new=1).

The procedure by which reimbursable expenses are processed varies and is dependent on contributor legal status (e.g. independent contractor, employee) and [subsidiary assignment](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tax/#tax-procedure-for-maintenance-of-gitlabs-corporate-structure). Check with Payroll if you are unsure about either of these.

For general information and guidelines regarding the company expense policy, check out the section of our team handbook on [Spending Company Money](/handbook/spending-company-money). Managers and the Accounts Payable team will review expenses for compliance with the company travel policy. The CEO will review selected escalations at least annually.

Team members should also consider the terms and conditions of their respective contractor agreements when submitting invoices to the company.

Team members are reimbursed on different schedules depending on their location. Please see the reimbursement process below to find the listing of reimbursement dates based on your location or employment status.

## Expense Policy Summary

1. Max Expense Amount - [$5,000 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/). **NOTE** - If you are a Corporate Credit Card holder, please refer to the [Corporate Credit Card page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/accounts-payable/corp-credit-cards/) for specific instructions and thresholds.
1. Itemized receipts are required for all business related expenses that are greater than $75 USD or equivalent to local currency.
1. Expenses should be submitted within 90 days of purchase, spend, or invoice due date. This helps the company to better manage our budget and ensures accurate month-end reporting.
   - If your purchase requires that you pre-pay for services, such as quarterly or yearly payments, you must split the cost monthly and only submit 1 month (or 1 payment) at a time for reimbursement.
   - If you are required to pay 250 every 3 months, divide the total cost by the # of months and that is what you submit each month.
   - You can use the same invoice copy each month.
1. Expense report items should clearly state if the spend includes amounts for clients / non-team members. Tax requirements in certain countries require us to account for client spend differently.
1. All team members must submit their expense reports in their designated policies in Expensify - COGS team members in COGS policies and non-COGS team members in non-COGS policies.
   - You can verify the policy that you are reporting in by review the title of your report: `Report Title: Team Member Name | Receipt Date: YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD | **Policy Name: GitLab- Amex** | Report ID: ######## | Total $XXX.XX`
   - The value next to *Policy Name* should match the entity, PEO, Country and COGS/Non-COGS department that you are employed with.  If these values are not a match, you can change them on the right hand side of the page - under Details, then under policy there is a drop down to choose from any policies you are a part of.
1. Gift cards are not accepted as a form of payment for business expenses.
1. All internet/telephone reimbursements must have a detailed receipt attached which shows the amount, service, and service date.
   - Please note we do not reimburse late fees, initial set up, or equipment costs.
## <i class="far fa-paper-plane" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Redacting Personal Information from Receipts - A Caution

As the expense tool does not require your personal information in order to process the reimbursement, we encourage you to redact your personal information before uploading receipts to protect your privacy. Managers should relay this caution to your team members, but we will no longer deny the expense report if receipt images contain personal information.

Consider redacting this information:

- Your shipping and billing address(es)
- Your credit card information
- Your full name
- Any other data that is personal to you that should not want publicly known

At a minimum, information about the items/products purchased and the total purchase amount should be visible so managers can validate the expense reimbursement amount requested along with the actual items and total purchase price.


### Rejected Expenses

Sometimes expenses get rejected by our third party accounting team (Montpac). Before following the steps below, please ensure your purchases are not identified in our [list of non-reimbursable expenses.](/handbook/finance/expenses/#--non-reimbursable-expenses). An expense might get rejected if it is more than 20% higher than the guideline price listed in our [office equipment and supplies](/handbook/finance/procurement/office-equipment-supplies/) handbook page.


## Expense Category and Policy

| Expense Category | Policy |
| ------ | ------ |
| **AirFare** | All airfares which are not submitted through TripActions can be reimbursed. Employees must purchase economy tickets, unless the employee has physical limitations and the upgrade is approved by their manager. GitLab does not cover expenses for significant others or family members. |
| **Car Rental** | All car rentals which are not submitted through TripActions can be reimbursed. Up to full sized car allowable. **Third Party Liability** - purchase the liability insurance that is excess of the standard inclusion of State minimum coverage in the rental agreement at the rental agency. GitLab’s insurance policy provides liability insurance for rental cars while conducting company business, but it may be excess over any underlying liability coverage through the driver or credit card company used to purchase the rental. Purchase the liability offered at the rental counter if there are foreign employees renting autos in the US or Canada. While workers' compensation would protect an injured US employee, other passengers may have the right to sue. To ensure that GitLab has protection when a foreign employee invites another person into the car we recommend the purchase of this insurance when offered at the rental counter. **Physical Damage/Collision Damage Waiver** - `DO NOT` purchase the Collision Damage Waiver offered at the rental counter. GitLab purchases coverage for damage to rented vehicles. If travel to Mexico is required, purchase the liability insurance for Mexico offered at the rental counter. You should verify that the rental agreement clearly states that the vehicle may be driven into Mexico and liability coverage will apply. **Countries other than the US and Canada**: **Third Party Liability** - purchase the liability insurance offered at the rental counter when traveling outside the US and Canada. Automobile Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability insurance are required by law in almost every country. Please verify this coverage is included with the rental agreement. **Physical Damage/Collision Damage Waiver** - purchase the Collision Damage Waiver or Physical Damage Coverage offered by the rental agency when traveling outside the US and Canada. In the event of an accident resulting in damage to the rental car, the foreign rental agency will charge the credit card used to make the reservation with an estimated amount of repair costs if insurance is not purchased. If this happens, GitLab does not purchase Foreign Corporate Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage to reimburse for damages. |
| **Co Working Space** | Reimbursable up to $700 USD. Must be pre-approved by Manager and Finance (email `expenses@gitlab.com`) before expensing. No contracts are allowed to be under the GitLab name and it must be under team members. Gitlab will not cover security deposits or advance payments for co-working space. The co-working space must be submitted monthly in the month it pertains to. |
| **Company Functions** | Reimbursable costs that are allowed are set in advance by GitLab management and are specific to each event. |
| **Conferences** | All costs associated with attending a conference to represent GitLab are reimbursable and a completed [Growth and Development form](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/) will need to be attached to the expense report upon submission. |
| **Gifts for Significant Life Events** | The event in question must pertain to a GitLab team member or the immediate family of a GitLab team member and will be allocated to the respective team members departmental budget-the spend range for significant life events is $75 to $125 USD. |
| **Hotel** | All hotel bills which are not submitted through TripActions can be reimbursed. Dry cleaning is allowable if the stay is over 3 days. Room service is allowable as a meal for ex. breakfast/lunch/dinner. Meals are to be segregated from the hotel bill and tagged under “Meals Company Provided” Category. Parking must be segregated and tagged under “Transportation”. Movies, mini bars are not allowed as a claim. |

| **Laptops** | All laptops are purchased through GitLab unless an employee is in a region where GitLab cannot deliver a laptop. Team member laptops can be refreshed after three years of employment. If a team member needs a replacement laptop due to damage, they must reach out to IT via an issue before purchasing a new one. [Laptop handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops) for your reference. |
| **Marketing Events** | It is used for making small reimbursable purchases for marketing events which are under $2,500 USD and which cannot be paid by Corporate Credit Card or through the Procurement Process (Coupa). |

### Approved Categories for Reimbursement

The company will reimburse for the following expenses if you need it for work or use it mainly for business, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring taxes:

1. Mileage is reimbursed according to local law: [US rate per mile](http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates), [rate per km in the Netherlands](http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/auto_en_vervoer/auto_van_de_onderneming/autokosten/u_rijdt_in_uw_eigen_auto), or [rate in Belgium](https://fedweb.belgium.be/nl/verloning_en_voordelen/vergoedingen/vergoeding-voor-reiskosten). Add a screenshot of a map to the expense in Expensify indicating the mileage.
1. Internet connection subscription.
    - For team members outside the Netherlands: follow normal expense report process.
    - For team members in the Netherlands: if you have not already completed the form as part of onboarding with our Netherlands payroll provider, fill in and sign the [Regeling Internet Thuis](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1J70geARMCjRt_SfxIY6spdfpTbv_1v_KDeJtGRQ6JmM/edit#heading=h.5x5ssjstqpkq) form and send it to the People Experience team at [people-exp@gitlab.com](mailto:people-exp@gitlab.com). The People Experience team will then send it to the payroll provider in the Netherlands via email. The details of the payroll provider can be found in the PeopleOps vault in 1Password under "Payroll Contacts".
        - **Important** This is the process to be followed for compliance reasons for Internet expenses for the Netherlands. Please do not expense your Internet costs via Expensify - these will be rejected.
        - If your address changes or the amount changes, please send a new form to the People Experience team, along with the invoice/letter for processing.
    - This is a taxable expense for GitLab Ltd. team members assuming that the internet connection is used partially for personal use as well as business use.
    - Please expense internet costs monthly, reflecting current charges only (even if you pay by a different cadence).
1. VPN service subscription. Please read [Why We Don't Have A Corporate VPN](/handbook/security/#why-we-dont-have-a-corporate-vpn), and check out our [Personal VPN page](/handbook/tools-and-tips/personal-vpn/) regarding usage at GitLab.
1. Mobile subscription, we commonly pay for phones if you use it frequently as a salesperson or executive, or if your position requires participation in an on-call rotation. For on-call, you may expense the cost of your mobile phone service for the month when you begin your on-call rotation. This is limited to your service cost itself, not any costs relating to the phone device, to a personal hotspot device or to services for other people on your phone plan. You may include additional data charges in your expense report as we understand you may have plans outside of your normal workspace while you're on-call.
1. Telephone land line (uncommon, except for positions that require a lot of phone calls)
1. Skype/Google Hangouts calling credit (uncommon, since we mostly use [internet-based services such as Zoom](/blog/2019/08/05/tips-for-mastering-video-calls/))
1. Co-working or rented office space if your are unable to work from your home. The are more details in the next section titled ["Co-Working or external office space"](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#co-working-or-external-office-space)
1. Laptops, insurance and repairs
    1. The [IT Ops](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops) page outlines laptop purchasing for new hires and for repairs and EOL for existing employees.
    1. Laptops paid for by the company are property of GitLab and need to be reported with serial numbers, make, model, screen size and processor to IT Ops by adding it to this form: [GitLab laptop information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUOlP11qeLdLZHTI62CFr7MSHAoI_1M6CRpnUA6fegkEKCOQ/viewform) for proper [asset tracking](/handbook/finance/accounting/#fixed-asset-register-and-asset-tracking). Since these items are company property, you do not need to buy insurance or an extended warranty for them unless it is company policy to do so (for example, at the moment we do not purchase Apple Care or extended warranties). You do need to report any loss following [Lost or Stolen Procedures](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#lost-or-stolen-procedures) or damage to IT Ops as soon as it occurs.
    1. **Repairs to company issued equipment.**
    - If you need to replace a battery or something small that does not affect the productivity or speed of the device, please go ahead and get that small item replaced and expensed. The category to use in Expensify is 'Laptop'.
    - Please get approval from your Manager if your equipment appears to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair. Business Operations can advise on next steps to ensure you have the proper equipment to work.
    - For loaner laptops: Do not hesitate when expensing a loaner laptop while your primary laptop is being repaired. Use your best judgment identifying a local vendor. Please check out our [laptop repair](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptop-repair) page for more info.
1. English lessons. At GitLab the lingua franca is [US English](/handbook/communication/#american-english), when English is not your native language it can limit you in expressing yourself.

### Co-Working or external office space

If working from home is not practical you may submit for reimbursement for the cost of a co-working or external office space. This can include non-traditional spaces that require a recurring (full-time monthly) membership as long as you average at least ~4 working days per month at the space. If flexible membership options exist in the form of daily passes or hourly packages, then these can be expensed as well, as long as the prorated cost per month does not exceed that of a recurring membership subscription. For instance, if both the monthly subscription and a hypothetical 10-day pass is $200 USD, then you can only expense one such pass each month.

Any agreement must be between the team member and the co-working space (i.e. GitLab will not sign or appear on the agreement). All expenses must be submitted through the normal expense procedure. The Company will not be responsible for the deposit, and therefore will not reimburse for the upfront deposit. This will solely be the responsibility of the employee. In addition, the company will not be responsible for any expense that relates to office space subsequent to the termination of service between GitLab and the team member.

If you are asked to pre pay for several months, or even the full year, you can only submit expenses monthly. Therefore you would take the total cost paid and divide by the number of months that you prepaid and expense that amount each month. Example: prepay 6 months at a total cost of $600. 600/6 = 100. So you would expense 100 each month via Expensify using the same invoice copy until you were fully reimbursed for that period. Unfortunately we cannot reimburse for prepayments that span multiple months in 1 lump sum.

There is no set limit for co-working space fees per month. We ask that you do your diligence and assure that you are selecting an economic option that will be suitable for your needs and also a reasonable cost for your location.

### Work-related online courses and professional development certifications

GitLab team members are allotted [$10,000 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) per calendar year to spend on one or multiple training courses. Follow the process for submitting a [Growth and Development Reimbursement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-benefit). 
1. Expenses related to reimbursement of tuition will be capped at $1,000 USD within Expensify. Anything over $1,000 USD must go through payroll for reimbursement. 
1. Team members must attach a screenshot of the G&D issue when submitting a expense report for tuition as well as their pass/fail grade report. 
1. Please select the "Training" category option. 

### Domain Name Registration and Maintenance Policy

#### Scope and Purpose
This policy applies to all GitLab team members registering, or maintaining a registration for, GitLab-related Domain Names, including GitLab-related Domain Names registered or used for sandbox or testing purposes.

Domain names are key assets in GitLab's intellectual property portfolio. Centralising the registration and maintainence of domain names under the Infrastructure Shared Services group using GitLab's approved domain name registrar helps us track and protect these valuable assets.

"**GitLab-related Domain Names**" when used in this policy means any domain name:
   - registered or used for any purpose related to a team member's role at GitLab;
   - containing the GitLab trademark (GITLAB) or one of its derivatives (like, amongst other things, git, glab, gtlb, gl); and/or
   - containing any GitLab key messaging term (like, amongst other things, devops, devops platform, all remote).
   
#### Registration of new GitLab-related Domain Names
- All GitLab-related Domain Names must be registered using the process outlined in the [dns-domain-purchase-request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/engineering/infrastructure/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=dns_domain_purchase_request) maintained by IT Operations.
- Expense reports submitted by team members for expenses incurred on or after `2022-03-01` in registering new GitLab-related Domain Names will be rejected.

#### Transfer of existing GitLab-related Domain Names
- All GitLab-related Domain Names currently registered in the name of team members, or registered with unapproved registrars, should be transferred to GitLab using the process outlined in the [dns-domain-transfer-request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/engineering/infrastructure/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=dns_domain_transfer_request) as soon as possible.
- Expense reports submitted by team members for expenses incurred on or after `2022-08-01` in maintaining registrations of GitLab-related Domain Names in the name of team members, or with unapproved registrars, will be rejected.

## Expense Reimbursement

## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Office Equipment and Supplies

The company will reimburse for these [office equipment and supplies](/handbook/finance/procurement/office-equipment-supplies/) if they <b>assist you in achieving greater business [results](/handbook/values/#results)</b>, and local law allows us to pay for items without incurring payroll taxes. Please keep in mind that any purchase (other than a laptop) that will cost GitLab $1000 USD per item (or over) will require prior approval from your Manager and Accounting.

### Setting up a home office for the first time?

Take inspiration from our [all-remote page covering key considerations for a comfortable, ergonomic workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/). You can also consult the `#questions` and `#remote` channels in Slack for recommendations from other GitLab team members.

When you evaluate the value of greater results relative to the cost of an item, we encourage you to [spend company money like its your own](/handbook/values/#spend-company-money-like-its-your-own). This means weighing the cost of a dollar spent to the value that it brings to the business, just as you would assess a personal dollar that you spend against the relative benefit that it brings you.

When reimbursing through Expensify please select "reimbursable" for the portion which GitLab will be covering, and add a note explaining the receipt difference.

- Please note Expensify cannot sync "non-reimbursable" line items, **only reimbursable line items are to be entered in Expensify**.

Team members should not use a Corporate Credit Card to purchase office equipment for their personal workspace. All office equipment purchases for a team member's personal workspace should be made on a personal credit card and expensed.

For Laptop Purchases/Refreshes, please refer to [IT Ops Laptop](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops) policy and procedure.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Software

1. We do not issue Microsoft Office 365 licenses, as GitLab uses Google Workspace
([Docs](/handbook/communication/#google-docs), Slides, Sheets, etc.) instead.
1. For security related software, refer to the security page for [laptop and desktop
configuration](/handbook/security/#laptop-or-desktop-system-configuration).
1. We do not currently issue Docker Desktop licenses (for more information see [team-member-enablement#1787](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues/1787)). For most team members the [alternatives documented on the Tools and Tips page](/handbook/tools-and-tips/mac#docker-desktop) may suffice. If you need an exception, please see the exception section on the same page

#### Individual Subscriptions

GitLab does not reimburse individual software subscriptions (e.g. Apple Music, Krisp, etc.). Software subscriptions should be set up through the [company procurement process](/handbook/finance/procurement/), or by [creating an access request for an existing company subscription](/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/).

##### Subscription Exceptions

Certain types of individual subscriptions are reimbursable, such as VPN service. If you are uncertain whether a particular service is reimbursable, please contact Finance by emailing `expenses@gitlab.com`.

If you need a short-term or individual software subscription, or a single-pay software license, please reach out to Finance by emailing `expenses@gitlab.com` to discuss options before acquiring the software.

### Transport/Delivery of Second Hand and Free Procurements
Feel free to check local second-hand/free markets when looking for equipment, especially furniture such as desks and chairs. GitLab will reimburse the cost of any transport and delivery services you need to procure the item(s) provided the total cost is reasonable based on the table in the [Office Equipment and supplies page](/handbook/finance/procurement/office-equipment-supplies/#home-office-equipment-and-supplies), factoring in any local pricing adjustments.

If you are able to find hidden gems in these markets, please go ahead and make the purchase. In order to expense these types of purchases, we ask that you take a screenshot or photo of the sale listing and any fund transfers or conversations between yourself and the seller on price and delivery costs. 

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Team Manager Flower and Gift Purchases

Managers are able to send Gifts and Flowers on behalf of their team members in acknowledgment of significant life events such as the birth of a little one; well wishes ahead of surgery, or the loss of a loved one.

The event in question must pertain to a GitLab Team Member or the immediate family of a GitLab Team Member and will be allocated to the respective team members departmental budget - the spend range for significant life events is **$75 to $125**.

Managers can facilitate the ordering of Flowers or Gifts for delivery, but please note that you are unable to send restaurant gift cards at this time. In an instance where you would like to extend the offer of a meal or food delivery service, this will need to be expensed by the recipient for reimbursement.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Reimbursements

The company will reimburse for the following expenses if you need it for work or use it mainly for business, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring taxes:
1. Mileage is reimbursed according to local law: [US rate per mile](http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates), [rate per km in the Netherlands](http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/auto_en_vervoer/auto_van_de_onderneming/autokosten/u_rijdt_in_uw_eigen_auto), or [rate in Belgium](https://fedweb.belgium.be/nl/verloning_en_voordelen/vergoedingen/vergoeding-voor-reiskosten). Add a screenshot of a map to the expense in Expensify indicating the mileage.
1. Internet connection subscription.
	* For team members outside the Netherlands: follow normal expense report process.
	* For team members in the Netherlands: fill in and sign the [Regeling Internet Thuis](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1J70geARMCjRt_SfxIY6spdfpTbv_1v_KDeJtGRQ6JmM/edit#heading=h.5x5ssjstqpkq) form and send it to the People Experience team at `people-exp@gitlab.com`. The People Experience team will then send it to the payroll provider in the Netherlands via email. The details of the payroll provider can be found in the PeopleOps vault in 1Password under "Payroll Contacts".
  * This is a taxable expense for GitLab Ltd. team members assuming that the internet connection is used partially for personal use as well as business use.
1. VPN service subscription. Please read [Why We Don't Have A Corporate VPN](/handbook/security/#why-we-dont-have-a-corporate-vpn), and check out our [Personal VPN page](/handbook/tools-and-tips/personal-vpn/) regarding usage at GitLab.
1. Mobile subscription, we commonly pay for that if you call a lot as a salesperson or executive, or if your position requires participation in an on-call rotation. For on-call, you may expense the cost of your mobile phone service for the month when you begin your on-call rotation. This is limited to your service cost itself, not any costs relating to the phone device, to a personal hotspot device or to services for other people on your phone plan. You may include additional data charges in your expense report as we understand you may have plans outside of your normal workspace while you're on-call. 
1. Telephone land line (uncommon, except for positions that require a lot of phone calls)
1. Skype/Google Hangouts calling credit (uncommon, since we mostly use [internet-based services such as Zoom](/blog/2019/08/05/tips-for-mastering-video-calls/))
1. Laptops, insurance and repairs
    1. The [IT Ops](/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops) page outlines laptop purchasing for new hires and for repairs and EOL for existing employees.
    1. Laptops paid for by the company are property of GitLab and need to be reported with serial numbers, make, model, screen size and processor to IT Ops by adding it to this form: [GitLab laptop information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUOlP11qeLdLZHTI62CFr7MSHAoI_1M6CRpnUA6fegkEKCOQ/viewform) for proper [asset tracking](/handbook/finance/accounting/#fixed-asset-register-and-asset-tracking). Since these items are company property, you do not need to buy insurance or an extended warranty for them unless it is company policy to do so (for example, at the moment we do not purchase Apple Care or extended warranties). You do need to report any loss following [Lost or Stolen Procedures](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#lost-or-stolen-procedures) or damage to IT Ops as soon as it occurs.
    1.  **Repairs to company issued equipment.**
        * If you need to replace a battery or something small that does not affect the productivity or speed of the device, please go ahead and get that small item replaced and submit for reimbursement in Expensify.
        * Please get approval from your Manager if your equipment appears to be damaged, defective, or in need of repair. Business Operations can advise on next steps to ensure you have the proper equipment to work.
        * For loaner laptops: Do not hesitate when expensing a loaner laptop while your primary laptop is being repaired. Use your best judgment identifying a local vendor. Please check out our [laptop repair](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptop-repair) page for more info.
1. English lessons. At GitLab the lingua franca is [US English](/handbook/communication/#american-english), when English is not your native language it can limit you in expressing yourself.


## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Travel and Expense Guidelines

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Travel

1. If you are taller than 1.95m or 6'5", you can upgrade to Economy Plus. There is no dollar restriction on this since it will be hard to fit in economy with that height.
1. For flights longer than 8 hours, you can expense:
    - Up to the first [$300 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for an upgrade to Business Class on flights longer than 8 hours if you are taller than 1.95m or 6'5".
    - Up to the first [$100 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for an upgrade to Economy Plus (no height restriction) on flights longer than 8 hours.
1. GitLab does not cover expenses for significant others or family members for travel or immigration. This includes travel and visas for GitLab events.
    - There are other things that [the company will not reimburse](/handbook/finance/accounting/#8-employee-reimbursements---expensify), such as dog boarding.

For additional Company Travel related questions, please refer to our [Travel Handbook](/handbook/travel/#booking-travel-through-tripactions-) regarding booking travel through TripActions.

### Spend reduction

When reducing spend, we'll not take the easy route of (temporarily) reducing discretionary spending.
Discretionary spending includes expenses like travel, conferences, gifts, bonuses, merit pay increases and Contributes.
By reducing in these areas we put ourselves at risk of [increasing voluntary turnover among the people we need most](https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free/).
Discretionary spending is always subject to questioning, we are frugal and all spending needs to contribute to our goals.
But we should not make cuts in reaction to the need to reduce spend; that would create a mediocre company with mediocre team members.
Instead, we should do the hard work of identifying positions and costs that are not contributing to our goals.
Even if this causes a bit more disruption in the short term, it will help us ensure we stay a great place to work for the people who are here.

## Expense Reimbursement for Terminated Team Members

If a team member whom you managed has left GitLab and comes to you with final expenses that are valid for reimbursement, please verify that they were not already processed in Expensify and then contact Accounts Payable. You must submit valid receipts and a completed copy of the [Expense Reimbursement template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0kWlqol7jBjqn7yDY6uc7UCWSIcUmiF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108533621432009168804&rtpof=true&sd=true) along with your approval. Please note that we may also ask the terminated team member to provide valid banking details in order to process the payment to them. 
AP will do their best to process and pay the reimbursement to the individual within 1 week.
