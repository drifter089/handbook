Weâ€™re excited to announce that GitLab will be launching Coupa in June!

Coupa is a procure-to-pay system that will help us streamline the purchase request process, initiate workflow with approvals, and enable Purchase Orders. We will be rolling out in a phased approach, starting with the US and Netherlands entities - GitLab Inc, Federal, IT BV and BV.

You can learn more about Coupa in our [FAQ Page](/handbook/finance/procurement/coupa-faq/)


#### Vendor Code of Ethics
All vendors that GitLab does business with, must legally comply with the [Supplier Code of Ethics](/handbook/people-group/people-policy-directory/#partner-code-of-ethics). When having discussions with your vendor regarding the contract, make them aware of this requirement.
