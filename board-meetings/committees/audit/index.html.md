**THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED CHARTER WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD ON 2021-03-18**

1. **Purpose**. The purpose of the Audit Committee (the "**Committee**") of the Board of Directors (the “**Board**”) of GitLab Inc. (the “**Company**”) is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to:
    - the Company’s accounting and financial reporting processes and internal controls, including audits and the integrity of the Company’s financial statements; 
    - the qualifications, independence and performance of the Company’s independent auditors (the “**Independent Auditors**”); 
    - risk assessment and management; and 
    - compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements. 

This charter (the “**Charter**”) sets forth the authority and responsibility of the Committee in fulfilling its purpose. The function of the Committee primarily is one of oversight.

    - **Chair.** The Board shall elect a Chair of the Committee, the Committee shall elect a Chair by majority vote.
    - **Selection and Removal.** Members of the Committee may be replaced or removed by the Board at any time, with or without cause. Resignation or removal of a director from the Board, for whatever reason, will automatically constitute resignation or removal, as applicable, from the Committee.
    - **Member Qualifications.** Members of the Committee must meet the following criteria as well as any additional criteria required by applicable law, the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) or such other qualifications as are established by the Board from time to time:

       - Each member of the Committee must be financially literate, as such qualification is interpreted by the Board in its business judgment, or must become financially literate within a reasonable period of time after his or her appointment to the Committee.

       - The principal responsibilities and duties of the Committee are set forth below.

       - The Committee shall discharge its responsibilities, and shall assess the information provided by the Company’s management and the Indepedent Auditors, in accordance with its business judgment.

The Independent Auditors are responsible for auditing the Company’s financial statements. The authority and responsibilities set forth in this Charter do not reflect or create any duty or obligation of the Committee to plan or conduct any audit, to determine or certify that the Company’s financial statements are complete, accurate, fairly presented, or in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or applicable law, or to guarantee the Independent Auditors’ reports.

    - **Internal Controls** With respect to the Company’s internal controls, the Committee will:

Establish procedures for (a) the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and (b) the confidential anonymous submission by employees of the Company of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.
