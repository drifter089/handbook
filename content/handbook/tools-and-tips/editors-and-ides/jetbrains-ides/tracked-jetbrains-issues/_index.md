## Overview

This is a list of all JetBrains issues which are relevant to GitLab, and we want to follow/upvote
in hopes that they eventually get fixed.

Here's the main issue trackers to look for existing issues before reporting a new one:

- RubyMine: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/RUBY
- GoLand: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/GO
- WebStorm: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/WEB

Each issue we track should have a `H3` section under the [Issues](#issues) section below.
It could be a table, but markdown tables are hard to maintain, and headers have automatic anchor links.
Here's a template example:

```markdown
## RUBY-30422

- Title: Rename can be invoked in empty string shared_examples
- Link: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RUBY-30422/Rename-can-be-invoked-in-empty-string-sharedexamples
- Available In: 2022.3 (will be blank if the issue is not yet resolved)
- Notes: (anything for easy searching within this page, e.g. mention `noinspection` if this is a
  bug for a false positive `noinspection` comment.
```

When an issue is resolved, the entry can be kept around for a few more releases, then deleted.

## Issues

Keep these sections sorted alphabetically. They are headers so that they can be directly linked.
