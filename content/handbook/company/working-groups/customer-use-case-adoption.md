title: "Customer Use Case Adoption"
description: "Drive cross-functional alignment around use case adoption as the north star KPI and #1 predictor of Churn & Contraction."
---

## Purpose

This working group is charged with driving the necessary cross-functional alignment, prioritization, and execution required to deliver improved customer adoption of key use cases within the GitLab platform. Following the 2023-05-16 Sales Key Review, there was a high-priority focus on driving customer use case adoption as the north star KPI and #1 predictor of Churn & Contraction. The formation of this working group was a direct outcome to accelerate efforts to win against GitHub and reduce Churn & Contraction.

**Desired Outcomes**

1. Drive **cross-functional alignment** around use case adoption across sales, customer success, product, data, finance, etc.
1. Mature **existing and new use cases and measures**, including thresholds
1. Build use cases as input into **actions** to drive the business
