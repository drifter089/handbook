## Summit Sessions

Summit isn’t a conference, it's a place to connect and collaborate in an environment where everyone can contribute. At GitLab Summit we have unconference sessions and workshops to create spaces where you can build connections with your fellow GitLab team members.

### Signup

1. We request everyone to propose sessions.
1. If you're suggesting a topic, we ask you to be the host. What this means is explained below under "how to host”.
1. GitLab team members will sign up for sessions. We limit attendance based on your guidelines.
1. We will provide the schedule of the sessions several weeks before the event so hosts can prepare.

Fill out the Summit Session volunteer form to volunteer to be a host.  The deadline for submissions is to be determined.

## Unconference

An unconference is a participant-driven meeting in which the agenda and content is created by the attendees. Unconferences emphasize informal connections over formal speeches by providing an open space for dialogue on topics relevant to the attendees. The unconference sessions allow team members to connect through shared interests.

### What to expect

1. Everyone can contribute.
1. Limited number of people in each session. (i.e. Small enough so that everyone can share.)
1. Content is generated from the discussion, not prepared ahead of time.
1. Each session has a GitLab issue on the project page for the event, and/or a Google Doc to capture notes.
1. Sharing in real-time is optional.
1. Everyone _can_ contribute, not everyone _must_ contribute.
   1. Some folks prefer to listen.
   1. Some folks prefer to think about the session then add comments to the issue or Google Doc later.
1. Can be GitLab or non-GitLab related
   1. GitLab related: produce notes that can be shared. Decide later if any action needs to be taken, such as creating an MR together on-site.
   1. Non-Gitlab related: Just have a discussion about something you enjoy with other people who enjoy the same thing to build a relationship (e.g. a hobby, technology advancements, etc.).

### How to host

1. This is a 50 minute session.
1. Give a short introduction (2-5 minutes) to the topic for folks that may not be familiar.
1. Ask some questions to get people talking then let the discussion flow organically, e.g. Why did you come to this session? You mentioned X, can you tell us more about that?
1. It's good to ask attendees this if they’ve been quiet or haven’t participated yet. Some folks are waiting for an invitation to speak and will appreciate being asked specifically to share. Some folks will say, “no thanks” and prefer to listen. Both are ok.
1. The host might need to interrupt someone who has just interrupted someone else so that everyone can contribute and one person doesn’t dominate the conversation.
1. Take 2-5 minutes to summarize the main points discussed at the end.

### Results

The following are measures of a successful unconference session:

1. Contribution: the more people contributing, the better.
1. Relationship building: these sessions are opportunities for people who enjoy the same thing to build relationships. It can be work subjects (architecture, burnout, how to focus, etc.) or non-work subjects (board games, cooking, or sharing recipes, snacks, or talk about favorite tv shows and movies).

## Workshops

### What to expect

1. A workshop is an interactive training of 50 minutes including Q&A (topic examples: Kubernetes 101, Speaker Training, AI, etc.)
1. Everyone can participate. It’s a workshop, not a presentation. Everyone in the room should be able to participate.
1. Can be a small or large number of people. Larger groups may need multiple facilitators or coaches to ensure everyone can participate.

### How to host

1. Requires preparation and coordination ahead of time to facilitate a productive workshop:
1. Room needs to be set up.
1. Outline or the training needs to be created.
1. Supplemental materials may need to be created.
1. Can be simple and lightweight (e.g. bring your laptop and learn: how to use git, how to make an MR, how to contribute to GitLab, etc. This is content that already exists in the handbook/website, but it can be very helpful to have someone walk you through it in person).

### Results

The following are measures of a successful workshop:

1. Equipping: People learn a new skill or improve an existing skill.
1. Participation: Everyone has the opportunity to participate.
