The future of work is about human empowerment. So, as a company, we at GitLab support both strategies of work-life balance and employee experience through our human-centric operational model: TeamOps. Based on autonomous ways of working. TeamOps enables users (internally or externally) to enjoy the schedule flexibility that comes along with async-first, handbook-first operations, but also activates an attractive work environment in workflows and processes, including:

- **Psychological Safety** – In this era of stronger diversity and inclusion, we all know the importance of inclusivity and belonging. However, TeamOps takes this even further by enforcing protocols that prevent our tenacious proactivity from becoming offensive, and other protocols that encourage healthy debate and feedback from all levels of our workforce, so everybody has an opportunity to voice their opinion. Even further, our prioritization of iteration enables our team to embrace imperfection and never consider any result irreversible.
- **Trust and Empowerment** – To fuel intrinsic motivation, each team member is equipped to work with a bias for action and have as much ownership in their day-to-day work as possible. We "push decisions to the lowest level" and cultivate a strong self-management mindset to confirm that everyone feels that they have authority and control.
- **Performance Transparency** - Measurement clarity tools like OKRs, KPIs, and cadences are fairly traditional. But in TeamOps, GitLab has uniquely blended them with our mission that “everyone can contribute” to create progressive productivity management strategies that enables all team members to know exactly which days they need to dig deep, and which days are best for them to enjoy some of their unlimited PTO. We even go so far as to encourage our staff to reduce the scope of their work when they’re feeling overwhelmed, so they can still achieving all of their goals on time without risking job security.

These points are a reflection of GitLab’s evolution from prioritizing our advocacy of [All-Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) to prioritizing our evangelism of TeamOps. **We want the world to understand that our success as a fully-distributed organization is not because of _where_ we’re working, it’s because of _how_ we’re working.**

### TeamOps Facilitator

Available only to internal team members, the TeamOps Facilitator certification program is an opportunity for passionate Practitioners and Trainers to upskill as topic thought leaders, and leverage their expertise through career development opportunities such as:

Participation as a TeamOps Facilitator is voluntary, unpaid, and is in addition to a team member’s primary role. To ensure that facilitation responsibilities do not conflict with any OKRs, manager approval is required as part of the application process.
