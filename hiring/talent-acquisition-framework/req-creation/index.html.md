## Requisition Creation Process

Prior to starting the req creation process, a Hiring Manager should follow the steps outlined to create a Job Family or create a MR to edit any relevant Job Family information as needed. For questions specific to Hiring Plans or how to go about making such changes, please refer to the [Finance section of the handbook](/handbook/finance/financial-planning-and-analysis/#headcount-and-the-recruiting-single-source-of-truth). The Hiring manager will then notify their [Recruiter](/handbook/hiring/recruiting-alignment/). The information they should be prepared to share with their Recruiter is as follows:

- Job Title
- Office or Territory
- GitLab Hiring Plan ID (if a role for R&D)
- Job Family URL
- Employment Type (New Hire or Backfill. If a backfill, the name of the teammate and last day of employment)

### Adding Vacancies to the Hiring Plan (DRI: Hiring Manager)

The Hiring Manager carries the responsibility to ensure that vacancies in Greenhouse align to what’s included in GitLab Hiring Plan. Therefore, the Hiring Manager, Finance, and Talent Acquisition can stay aligned on what’s in plan, so that they can track towards their predetermined hiring targets. If you are looking to add or make changes to the GitLab Hiring Plan, please visit the [Finance section of the handbook](/handbook/finance/).

### Create or Review the Job Family (DRI: Hiring Manager)

Once the vacancy is approved, the Hiring Manager will review the position description in the `/job-families` folder and update it, if needed. If there is no existing job family, follow the steps to [create a new job family](/handbook/hiring/job-families/#job-families). A compensation benchmark for the role should be set by working with the Compensation & Benefits team.

### Opening Vacancies in Greenhouse (DRI: Recruiter)

For positions that are included in the GitLab Hiring Plan, the Recruiter will create approved in-plan requisitions.

**The Recruiter will:**

1. [Log in](/handbook/hiring/greenhouse/#how-to-join-greenhouse) to [Greenhouse](https://gitlab.greenhouse.io/users/sign_in) and hover over the plus sign in the top right corner of their dashboard, and then click [Create a Job](https://app2.greenhouse.io/plans/new).
1. Click on [Start from a copy of an existing job](https://gitlab.greenhouse.io/get_started/show_existing_jobs). From there, select `Any Status` at the top bar, select `Draft`, and choose the template for the division. Please note that when creating a requisition, the `Start from Scratch` option should **not** be used, as important elements needed will **not** be included.
1. Once you've selected a template to copy, the first screen will ask for **Basic Job Info**.
1. The `Internal Job Name` is only viewable within Greenhouse, and the `External Job Name` is what appears on the jobs page. Enter in the requisition's title in these fields, including _Specialty_, if applicable. These two fields should almost always be the same, but if you have questions, please reach out to the Compensation & Benefits Team.
    - If only internal candidates will be considered for the role, job title should read "CURRENT TEAM MEMBERS ONLY - Job Name"
1. `Department` is the department this role will fall under. Always choose a department and **not** a division (e.g. for a Security Engineer vacancy, choose **Security** within the `Engineering` division, and do **not** choose `Engineering`). If you are unsure of what department to choose, reach out to the Compensation & Benefits team.
1. If a requisition can be located anywhere GitLab hires, check `Anywhere` next to `Office`. If a vacancy is dedicated to a certain region or time zone, uncheck the `Anywhere` box and select any of the predetermined regions or time zones. If a region or time zone is not shown in the list, please reach out to the [Recruiting Ops Team](https://gitlab.com/gl-talent-acquisition/operations/-/issues/new). In addition to the region or time zone you've selected, it's recommended to also choose `Remote` so that it's clear to applicants that the vacancy is both located in a particular area but also still remote.
1. Click `Generate IDs` to create a requisition ID
1. Under `Employment Type`, select if your vacancy is a _Full-Time_, _Part-Time_, _Intern_, or _Contract_ role. We strongly advise offering both full-time and part-time options for most requisitions. Please note that _Contract_ refers to a true consultant, who works on short-term projects. This is seldom used.
1. `Salary` will be input by the Total Rewards Team. The salary can be found in the [Compensation Calculator](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/), which is available to all team members and advanced candidates.
    - Take the `benchmark x level x 0.45` for the low end and `benchmark x level x 0.8` on the high end.
    - For roles not in the compensation calculator: Leave blank if not known. The Total Rewards team will edit as the first level of approval. The Total Rewards will pull survey data in San Francisco for this role then apply the same formula for `0.45` on the low end and `0.8` on the high end.
1. Scroll down to the `Openings Secton`
1. Click `Generate Opening IDs` to create an opening ID
1. Enter the `Target Start Date` as listed on the GitLab Hiring Plan
1. Enter the `Hiring Manager`
1. Under `Type` choose if this is a _New Hire_ or a _Backfill_. If you select _Backfill_, please enter the name of the teammate you are backfilling on the line below.
1. Enter the `GHP ID` listed on the GitLab Hiring Plan
1. Click `Create Job & Continue`.
1. The next page consists of all of the **attributes** interviewers will be evaluating for candidates in their scorecards across the full interview process. These may not be known until after the Kick-off Session and may be skipped during the initial setup of the REQ. The Recruiter will pdate the scorecard after the kick-off Session.
1. Click `This looks good, NEXT` at the right of your screen.
1. The `Interview Plan`, is where you'll craft the hiring process and scorecards for each step in the process. The interview plan may not be known until after the Kick-off Session and may be skipped during the initial setup of the REQ. The Recruiter will update the interview plan after the Kick-off Session.
1. Click `This looks good, NEXT` at the right.
1. The `Hiring Team` is where you select who will be working on this vacancy and what access they should have.
    - Scroll to the `Who's responsible for this job?` to assign the Hiring Managers, [Recruiter(s)](/handbook/hiring/recruiting-alignment/), Coordinator(s) and Sourcer(s). Everyone who will be involved in interviewing may not be known until after the Kick-off Session. The Recruiter will update the Hiring Team after the Kick-off Session.
1. Click `This looks good, NEXT` at the right.
1. Approvals section is where you can add any notes here for the vacancy where it says `Leave a note`.
    - If you were unable to determine the compensation information tag the Compensation and Benefits team in the Approval Notes section with an @ mention.
    - @ mention the Hiring Manager, Recruiter, Sourcer, Sourcing Manager, and People Business Partner (PBP) so they know the REQ has been submiotted for approval.

```

#### Update the Scorecard

1. Update the `Scorecard` after the kick-off Session. The attributes are typically split up into various categories, such `Requirements` (copied from the job family), `Responsibilities` (copied from the job family), `Skills`, `Traits`, and `Values` (standard across all roles, see additional info in the next step).
    - These can be adjusted as needed, but **every** attribute listed should be a must-have and not a nice-to-have.
    - If you want to include nice-to-haves in the scorecard, please create a new category called `Nice-to-haves` and add any applicable attributes there, making sure that your entire interview team knows that if a candidate does not meet any of those attributes it is not a negative against them.
1. To create a new category, scroll to the bottom of the screen and select `Add a Category`, and add the name of the category. In the category you can add additional attributes.
1. To remove a category, hover over the category, and click, `Delete Category`.
1. The only required category is `Values`, which should never be deleted. The values are listed in such a way to match how the values listed on our contracts.
    - Collaboration: Helping others, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that I am trying to achieve. Similarly, I will rely on others for help and advice.
    - Results: Doing what I promise for my fellow team members, our customers, our users, and our investors.
    - Efficiency: Caring about working on the right things, not doing more than needed, and not duplicating work. Dogfooding: Willingness to work with git and GitLab, using GitLab workflows within the team. (this attribute falls under the efficiency value and is called out separately, not as an additional value, but as an important key to success)
    - Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging: Fostering an environment where everyone can thrive and feel included.
    - Iteration: Doing the smallest thing possible and get it out as quickly as possible.
    - Transparency: Being as open about as many things as possible.
1. Add Custom Questions to all interviews in the Team Interview Stage. Every interviewer must have a place to include "Pros" and "Cons". [How to add custom questions.](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/115002276366-Create-Custom-Questions-for-Interview-Kits)
1. To edit the attributes within a category, click `Edit` next to the category. You can then change the name of attributes, delete attributes, add brand new ones, or choose existing attributes from other vacancies. Keeping the attribute names the same and choosing existing attributes from other vacancies is recommended so that the attribute choices remain streamlined. However, if you have a particular attribute for this role that needs to be evaluated, don't hesitate to add it.
1. Click `Save` once you've configured your attributes and categories. If you don't want to save your changes after you've clicked `Edit` under a category, click `Cancel`.

#### Update the Interview Plan

1. Update the `Interview Plan` after the Kick-off Session.
1. Every vacancy should have an `Get to Know Us` stage. This is also known as Application Review by the Greenhouse Milestone.
1. Some vacancies have an `Assessment` as the second stage in the process.
    - If your vacancy requires an assessment but there is no assessment stage already added, scroll to the bottom of the page and click `Add a Stage`.
    - From there, you can either click `Copy from another job?` at the bottom of the pop-up and select a vacancy you know has an assessment. Click on `Assessment`, then `Add`.
    - If you're not sure of another vacancy that has an assessment, you can scroll to the bottom of the pre-populated list and select `Take Home Test`, then `Add`.
    - Once added, hover over the new stage and click the pencil next to the stage name and change the text from `Take Home Test` to `Assessment`. Then hover over the second `Take Home Test` on the right of the stage and change the text again.
    - The assessment stage **must** be added using one of the two methods above, or it will not work properly. If you have any questions about this, please reach out to the talent acquisition operations team.
    - Once your assessment stage is created, or if it is already included, click `Edit` in the stage. You'll then want to select any attributes you want the grader of the assessment to focus on. This will typically be more technical in nature, but select whatever seems appropriate.
    - Scroll down to `Email to Candidate`. This is where you'll include the actual assessment questions. The "From" should be `{{MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS}}` and "Subject" `GitLab Application - {{CANDIDATE_NAME}} - {{JOB_NAME}} Questionnaire`. In the Body, craft an email and insert your assessment questions. Below the body, make sure that the `link for candidates to submit tests` is **ON**. You can also add any attachments below that field if necessary.
    - Scroll down to `Grading Instructions` and include any specific items you want your graders to look out for when they review the candidates' answers. You can copy this section over from another job if applicable.
    - Under `Custom Questions`, be sure that there is either a `Full Notes` custom question or that you add one. To add it, simply click `Add Custom Question`, title it `Full Notes`, choose `Text` as the answer type, and click `Add Custom Question`. If there are any other specific questions you want your graders to answer when reviewing the assessment, feel free to add them here. They can be required or not, depending on your preference.
    - Under `Graders and Notifications`, search for members of your team who can grade the assessments. You can select multiple people at this point, and when the assessments are actually sent out to candidates, each grader will appear and the person sending the assessment can delete extras so it is only sent to one person. You can also select who you want to be notified when the test is received; the test graders should absolutely be selected, and it's recommended for the recruiter to be notified as well. You can select any additional people to be notified as well if desired.
    - Finally, under `Additional Settings`, check `This interview requires scorecards to be submitted` and leave **unchecked** `Hide candidate name and details from grader`.
    - Then click `Save`.
1. The next stage is the `Screening` call stage, which should be standard across the organization. Click `Edit` on this stage, scroll to the bottom, and choose the recruiter as the default interviewer and set interview duration to 30 minutes. It is important for this stage to be named the same across the organization for reporting purposes.
1. The next stage is `Team Interview`, where the candidates will meet with peers and the hiring manager. Under this stage, you should see multiple interviews. They are typically called 1 - Hiring Manager, title (name), 2 - Peer Interview, title (name), 2 - Peer Interview, title (name), etc. You can also add additional interviews such as 3 - Director Interview, title (name), 4 - Demo with Panel, titles (names), or other names that work for your interview plan.
    - The `Team Interview` stage should be laid out according to steps, indicated by the 1, 2, 3, etc. There can be more than 1 interview in a step to help speed up the interview process and reduce our apply to accept KPI.
    - The interview plan should be defined during the intake call to include what attributes from the scorecard each interviewer is addressing as well as standard questions each interview should ask.
    - The interview plan should be duplicated in the [hiring process repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/hiring-processes).
    - The interview plan should also be defined on the job family page under the Hiring Process section.
1. For each interview, click `Edit`.
    - Select the appropriate attributes to focus on in that interview.
    - To the right of `Interview Prep`, choose how long the interview should take (e.g. 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, etc.).
    - Include the purpose of the call and questions the interviewer should ask. You can copy this over from another vacancy if applicable.
    - Under `Custom Questions`, be sure that there is a `Full Notes` custom question in addition to the interview specific questions.
    - To add additional questions, click `Add Custom Question`, title it `Full Notes`, choose `Text` as the answer type, and click `Add Custom Question`.
    - Choose default interviewers. If you have multiple team members that can interview, feel free to input all of their names, and the CES will choose one interviewer when scheduling the interview. This gives visibility to everyone who is trained and ready to perform interviews for this vacancy.
    - The two `Additional Settings` should both be checked.
    - Click `Save`.
1. Some teams prefer to have the hiring manager stage broken out separate from `Team Interview` stage and in that case, a stage labeled `Hiring Manager Interview` should be added. To add a new interview in a stage, hover over the stage and click `Add Interview`, then you can copy over an interview from another job or create a new one. You can also move the interviews around within the stage and change the interview names. `Executive Interview` are included in this stage. Depending on the level of the role the executive interviews may be conducted at the end or at any point in the team interview stage. You can customize as needed, including selecting attributes, adding custom questions, setting the interview length and selecting a default interviewer.
1. The next stage is `Background Check & References`, with at least three sections; a former manager and two former peers. These can be customized as needed. For executive-level roles, it is suggested you include the following; two former managers, two former peers, two former direct reports, and back-channel. The [background check](/handbook/people-policies/#background-checks) is performed during this stage.
1. There is an optional `Justification` section used by the R&D division. This section should include three questions:
    - In what specific way(s) does this candidate make the team better?
    - What flags were raised during the interview process?
    - How do we intend on setting this candidate for success?
1. The last stage is the `Offer` stage and cannot be edited or removed. Some important notes about the interview plan:
    - Every interview should be evaluating values add in the attributes section.
    - On occasion, there may be additional or fewer stages than represented here, but these stages should be consistent as much as possible in order to maintain data integrity for reporting. The interviews within the stages can be adjusted as needed.
    - If a candidate will have more interviews in a stage than predetermined, you can add additional interview events as long as the candidate is in the stage where you need to add the additional event.

#### Update the Hiring Team

1. Update the `Hiring Team` after the Kick-off Session.
1. The Hiring Team is where you select who will be working on this vacancy and what access they should have.
    - Scroll to the `Who's responsible for this job?` to assign the Hiring Managers, [Recruiter(s)](/handbook/hiring/recruiting-alignment/), Coordinator(s) and Sourcer(s).
    - Scroll to the `Who can see this job?` section to set permissions to the team members who will need access. Search for someone's name click the pencil and select the correct access level from the drop-down.
    - Search for every person who will be in the hiring process, whether they will be grading assessment, reviewing new applications, or performing interviews.
    - You may need to go back to the interview plan to add the interviews if it did not let you add them before completing this step.

#### Update Notifications

1. Review notifications and ensure they align to the preferences of you and the hiring team.

### Publish the Job to the Careers Page & Review Greenhouse Configuration (DRI: CES Team)

**The Candidate Experience Team will:**

1. Post the vacancy to the [Careers Page](/jobs/careers/) once they receive notice from the recruiter.
1. Review the configurations the Talent Acquisition Manager and Recruiter made and ensure everything is correct; reach out to them to ask clarifying questions if there is anything you don't understand or if there is anything missing.
1. Ensure each stage is labeled correctly for reporting purposes:
    - Get to Know Us
    - Screening
    - Assessment
    - Hiring Manager Interview
    - Team Interview
    - Technical Interview
    - Justification
    - Background Check & References
    - Offer
1. Confirm each person in the hiring process has appropriate access and upgrade if necessary in [Greenhouse](/handbook/hiring/greenhouse/#access-levels-and-permissions).
1. Confirm each interviewer has completed an [Interview Training Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/Training/issues/new).
1. The CES may choose to send the following email to each member of the interview team:
Subject: Interview Training Issue and Google Office Hours
Body: Can you please make sure you have your office hours set up in your calendar? This will help me schedule the interview right the first time and save you and the candidate time and frustration. You can learn how [here](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en).
Also, if this is your first time conducting interviews on behalf of GitLab I will need to create an interview training issue for you. Please let me know if that is the case.
As always, If you have any questions let me know!
Thanks, xxx

### Reqs going Outbound to Inbound 

Once it's been decided that the req is ready to go inbound, the recruiter should follow the steps below to ensure the job shows up correctly on 3rd party job boards.

If the job should only be advertised in a specific country (e.g. Japan, Germany), the LinkedIn Job Wrapping codes are not necessary. LinkedIn will pull the specific country from the `Publish to Free Job Boards` location within Greenhouse. 

If the job is regional (e.g. APAC, EMEA, LATAM), recruiters can make sure it is added to LinkedIn by following the steps below:

- Click on the < > on the menu bar in the description text box to open the source code
- Scroll to the bottom of the pop-up
- Paste the following HTML `<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="color: white">Remote-XXX</span></span></div>` at the bottom and change the letters in Remote-XXX to the appropriate code for the current available LinkedIn Job Wrapping location(s)
- Please copy directly from the sheet because spaces matter
- The default tag should be Remote-Global if no other locations were given by the recruiter
- GitLab team members can review [job wrapping tags here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CrrPGk3imxrap7Na3AQTQ0lmw2ENyZ51/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100237668635376025864&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- Click Ok

If multiple tags are added to the description, please enter the additional tag on a new line. For example:

`<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="color: white;">Remote-EMEA</span></span></div>`
`<div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="color: white;">Remote-North America</span></span></div>`

While tags are not visible on the Greenhouse posting, they will appear when viewed on LinkedIn. So, please, be mindful of how many tags are added to any one particular requisition.

Once the LinkedIn coding is complete, the CES will make the external job post live.

### Publishing Vacancies on External Job Boards

Sometimes we need to post vacancies on specialist job boards to attract talent. The budget for this will come from the Department with the open vacancy, and department leaders will need to approve the neccessary budget.
