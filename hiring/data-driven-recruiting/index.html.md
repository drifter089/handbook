## Data Driven Recruiting at GitLab

Data Driven Recruiting is defined as focusing on fewer people that have more aptitude and connection to the company. This approach helps to optimize the entire hiring process by leveraging the data on the candidates we're more likely to hire and those who are more likely to respond to our reach out. 

Since GitLab has taken an innovative approach to hiring and implemented the [Outbound Recruiting Model](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/faq/#gitlabs-outbound-recruiting-model), we aim to enrich our sourcing strategy with specific market data points. Data Driven Recruiting approach presents us with the specific data collected on the prospects, it can give us a broader understanding of the market we are interested in. It also makes us more mindful and strategic when it comes to our sourcing approach.

As we aim to build an even more diverse team in the most efficient way possible, while also sustaining our culture, we create a list parameters that could be considered when building the sourcing strategy for a particular opening, and this list keeps growing:
1. Affinity and engagement with GitLab Talent Brand
1. Expressed interest in our current or past openings
1. Skillset alignment
1. [Preferred companies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/preferred-companies/)
1. Company connections
1. Longevity
1. Potential contribution to GitLab's diversity
1. Contribution to GitLab's efficiency

### General guidelines
While there are different ways of combining the signals listed above, our goal is to use Data Driven Recruitment approach at the beginning of the search to build robust pipeline and oprtimize our sourcinng effort. These are the steps you can take to adopt the Data Driven Approach to your search:

1. Define your hiring needs and the purpose of the DDR to understand what results youâ€™d like to get.
1. Break down the project into steps, for example: 
- Defining cues and segmenting the market;
- Sourcing and outreach;
- Recruiting.
3. Segment the market based on different cues you are interested in collecting the data on and proceed to sourcing and recruiting.
