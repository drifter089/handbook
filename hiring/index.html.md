## Introduction 
At the core of our team’s vision, mission, and strategy is our ability to impact GitLab’s overarching [mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/): to make it so that **everyone can contribute**. When **everyone can contribute**, users become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of innovation. 

As a Talent Acquisition team, we have an outsized impact on GitLab’s ability to make this mission a reality, by connecting top talent to profound careers from wherever they are in a truly distributed, remote workforce. 

### Talent Acquisition Vision Statement
To create globally inclusive access to opportunities so that **everyone can contribute**.

### Talent Acquisition Mission Statement
It is the Talent Acquisition Team’s mission to predictably build distributed, representative teams that enable our vision of creating globally inclusive access to opportunities so that **everyone can contribute**. 

### Our Guiding Principles
As we set out over the next decade to achieve this vision, we will continue to rely on core guiding principles to define how we build toward the future. 
  1. **Experience**: Stakeholder experience is central to all that we do. We are not purely a service provider but a partner and advisor in creating a best-in-class experience while building GitLab as a company. The Talent Acquisition team looks after building an experience for our customers, stakeholders, and partners that stands true to our [CREDIT](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) values and provides a level of care we are proud of - no matter the outcome. 
  1. **Inclusivity**: Applying best practices in the craft of Talent Acquisition has an outsized impact on our ability to build a representative workforce here at GitLab. By embedding inclusivity as a guiding principle, we design fair and equitable processes into the fabric of all that we do, rather than retroactively adding parameters to solve systemic challenges in the societies we exist in   
  1. **Predictability**: Our ability to have the right people, in the right jobs, at the right time is imperative to our ability to execute our commitments and plans as an organization. In order to achieve that, our team must design with an eye for accuracy and forecastability in any program, process or experience we enable. 

### Our Objectives and Roadmap
We strive to be as transparent as possible, but these sections are only available for our GitLab team members.

<summary markdown="span">Shared Definitions</summary>

* **Job:** A job refers to the job title (ex: Customer Support Specialist). This will also be what appears on external job boards. In the case there are multiple positions open that are the same, and we only want to list once, we can have multiple 'openings' (see next section) opened within one 'Job'. Each job will have a unique identifier called a Requisition ID (example- 1001).

* **Opening:** A job can have multiple openings attached to it (ex: you are hiring 3 Customer Support Specialists. You would then have 1 ‘Job’ and 3 ‘openings’ against that job). A job can have multiple openings against it, but an opening can not be associated with multiple jobs. Each opening will have a unique identifier called an Opening ID (example- 1001-1, 1001-2, 1001-3).

* **GHPiD:** GHP ID is the link between Adaptive (what we use to track our operating plan) and Greenhouse (our ATS). A GHP ID has a one to one relationship with an Opening ID. It is the key interlock between our hiring plans and our Talent Acquisition activity. This is a custom field in Greenhouse.

<summary markdown="span">Evergreen requisitions</summary>

  * [Creating an evergreen req](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/evergreen-requisitions/)<br>
  * [Evergreen req guide](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/evergreen-requisitions/)<br>
  * An Evergreen Job is a requisition that is 'always open'. More specifically, it is used when we have at least 3 openings for a particular job repeated each quarter. There is then one Evergreen job posted for internal, external and passive candidates. It is important that no candidate is hired to an Evergreen job, and instead is moved to an approved opening (aka an opening with a single corresponding GHPiD). TA Leadership will open EVG roles at the start of a fiscal year, with a quarterly review cadence, by leveraging the hiring plan and attrition assumptions. See the pages above for more information.<br>
  + <details><summary markdown="span">Tips and Tricks</summary>
   
     * Know your department before you open your req. If you need to change the department name later, the approval chain will not automatically update. If this happens to you, please contact Enablement.
     * We do not re-open jobs after they have been closed. This is because permissions and approvers may have changed in the time since the job was first closed.
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Post a job in Greenhouse</summary>
   * [Post an **internal** job](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-creation/#opening-vacancies-in-greenhouse-dri-recruiter)<br>
   * [Post an **external** job](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-creation/#publish-the-job-to-the-careers-page--review-greenhouse-configuration)<br>
   + <details> <summary>Tips and Tricks</summary>
     * Salary transparency: In select US states, GitLab discloses salaries in job descriptions in accordance with local laws. Total Rewards will add this information to the job’s approvals page. When you create your _external_ job post, utilize Pay Transparency Rules and select Hiring in the USA. If the job will not be posted in the US, select N/A.<br>
     * EEOC questions should be checked off in the US only<br>
     * [Click here](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-creation/#choosing-the-correct-location-for-your-published-job) for more information on selecting the correct location for your job. This will help ensure that your LinkedIn listings are posted in the correct countries.<br>
     * Our jobs are now set up to automatically go to Indeed and Glassdoor and be posted as remote roles on both sites. Recruiters should unselect or leave unselected the option in Greenhouse to "publish to free job boards" as this requires us to input city, state, and country data that overrides the remote job listing. There is an automation in place to automatically send jobs to Indeed and Glassdoor.<br>

<details><summary markdown="span">Req access and permissions</summary>

  * As a member of the Talent Acquisition team, you have the ability to add team members to view your job with differing layers of access. By default, all team members can access the interview kit & scorecard of someone they’re interviewing and this access does not need to be granted. For team members who require additional access, such as a Hiring Manager or their EBA, you will need to grant that access where appropriate.<br>
  * As you are deciding what access level someone should have, default to the setting that allows the most confidentiality for a candidate. If a team member does not need access to scorecards, for example, we should be choosing an access level that does not allow them to see them. A job admin (someone with higher level permissions) typically should not be at the same level or a direct report of a job they have access to. Enablment is in the process of creating a table with specific information about each level, which we will link to here when it is complete.<br>
  * To add or remove access in a job, go to ‘job setup’ and click ‘hiring team’. Add or remove access under “Who can see this job?”. Unfortunately, there is no way to bulk add or remove access. You can also add and remove access when creating your job from a template. If you are searching for a team member and cannot find their name, ensure that you do not have filters activated. Do not add access to templates, because this could create problems in the future.
  </details>


<details><summary markdown="span">Set up scorecards and interview plans</summary>

  * There are two elements of a scorecard: the Scorecard section and the Interview Plan section. Both are accessible through Job Setup.
  * [**Scorecard**](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/req-creation/#update-the-scorecard) Depending on your department, you may have a lot of your scorecard options pre-filled. R&D scorecards are always set up for you, and may only require small tweaks depending on technical language or job grade.
  * [**Interview Plan**](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/115002276366-Add-an-interview-question-to-an-interview-kit)
  + <details><summary markdown="span">Tips and Tricks</summary>

    * Name your interviews in a way that will help your Candidate Experience Specialist partner schedule your interview. We recommend ‘Topic -  Interviewer - Time’ i.e. ‘Values Interview - Beyonce Knowles - 45 min’. If you are pulling from a large interviewer pool, you can discuss with your Candidate Experience Specialist partner if it makes sense to create a Prelude interviewer pool that will help with scheduling.
    * Once you have set up the stages and interview names, add the specific interview questions asked into the “Interview Questions” section of the Interview Plan.
    * If you need to make bulk changes to a large number of jobs’ scorecards at once, Enablement has the ability to make bulk changes. Please contact them for assistance.
    * Recruiters don’t need to be the only ones adding interview questions to the interview plan. Invite your Hiring Manager to complete this task alongside you.
