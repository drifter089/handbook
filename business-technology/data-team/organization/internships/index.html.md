## <i class="far fa-newspaper" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Data Team Internships

The Data Team Internship program is modeled after the [Internship for Learning Program](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internship-for-learning) and [Engineering Internship Program](/handbook/engineering/internships/).

In Calendar 2022, the Data Team is launching a pilot Internship program and seeks to experiment with the program over the course of 2022 to determine its long-term viability. Data Team Internships will follow one of two categories:
- Internship for a current GitLab Team Member
- Internship for a non-GitLab Team Member

`At this time the pilot only supports Internships for current GitLab Team Members.`

### Criteria For Internships

Requests for opening a intern position will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Team Size, Maturity, and Need
     * How established is the team the intern will be joining? Is this an established team with processes, roles, a roadmap, and backlog?
     * Will the team be able to take on an intern without risking a decrease in velocity?
     * Would the team benefit from an intern to support a more senior member's career development, to introduce new perspectives, or to accelerate the roadmap in one or more areas.
1. Mentorship Commitment
     * Does the team have a manager and 1-2 individual contributors committed to serve as mentors for the duration of the program?
     * Do the mentors have previous experience mentoring interns or junior engineers? Previous experience is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have.
1. Workload
     * Does the team have a roadmap containing low weight issues with few dependencies suitable for an intern?

If the answer to these questions is **YES**, there is a good chance the internship is a fit.

### What Does An Intern Do?

The internship program will give you insight into the [Data Team role](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/organization/#data-roles-and-career-development) by providing you opportunities to contribute through it. You will be fully integrated into the team through Data Onboarding and be assigned **real** projects that contribute to Quarterly Objectives and the [Data Team Roadmap](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/direction/). In the GitLab Data Team we believe in full end-to-end ownership of the work we do, ranging from requirements gathering all the way to production deployment and operations. During your internship you will be assigned a Senior team member as a mentor-manager, who will help you to navigate in daily tasks.  Examples of your tasks will include:

- Requirements gathering
- Extraction of data from various sources to support projectâ€™s objective
- Analysing and visualising data to develop new insights
- Collaboration with stakeholders (including explaining technical concepts with non-technical language)
- Working in GitLab to manage projects (via epics and issues)
- Writing new source code and merging the code through a Merge Request
