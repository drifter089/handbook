## Data Internships

The Data Team Internship program is modeled after the [Internship for Learning Program](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internship-for-learning) and [Engineering Internship Program](/handbook/engineering/internships/).

The Data Team is launching a pilot Internship program in Calendar 2022 and seeks to experiment with the program over the course of the year to determine its long-term viability. Internships will follow one of two categories:
- Internship for a current GitLab Team Member
- Internship for a non-GitLab Team Member

`At this time the pilot supports Internships for current GitLab Team Members.`

### Criteria For Internships

Requests for opening a intern position will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Team Size and maturity
     * How established is this team? 
     * Will they be able to take on an intern without risking a decrease in velocity?
1. Mentorship
     * Does the team have a manager and 1-2 individual contributors willing to serve as mentors for the duration of the program?
     * Do the mentors have previous experience mentoring interns or junior engineers? Previous experience is a nice-to-have, but not a must-have.
1. Workload
     * Does the team have a roadmap containing low weight issues with few dependencies suitable for an intern?

### What Does An Intern Do?

The internship program will give you insight into the specified Data role and its normal responsibilities. You will be fully integrated into the team through Data Onboarding and be assigned **real** projects that contribute to Quarterly Objectives and the [Data Team Roadmap](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/direction/). Examples of tasks include:

In the GitLab Data Team we believe in full end-to-end ownership of the work we do from requirements gathering to production deployment and operations. 

During your internship you will be assigned a Senior team member as a mentor-manager, who will help you to navigate in daily tasks. 

- Requirements gathering
- Extraction of data from various sources to support projectâ€™s objective
- Analysing and visualising data
- Collaboration with stakeholders (including explaining technical concepts with non-technical language)
- Working in GitLab to manage projects (via epics and issues)
