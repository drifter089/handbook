# Data Science at GitLab

The mission of the Data Science team is to help understand business, customers and products better with model-based insights.

We do this by building machine learning models and analysing data to convert results into trusted and scalable products.

## Tools 

Currently, Data Science team uses Python and Jupyter to deliver projects. 

# Data Science responsibilities

Responsibilities of data scientists are outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/finance/data-science/) 

Additionally, the **Data Science Team** supports the following responsibilities
- With the **Data Leadership Team**:
    - Defining and publishing a Data Science roadmap to expand analytical capabilities
    - Broadcasting regular updates about data deliverables, ongoing initiatives, and upcoming plans
- With the [**Data Engineering Team**](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/organization/engineering/#data-engineering-responsibilities):
    - Helping to define and champion Data Quality practices and programs for GitLab data systems

# Projects structure
Data Scientists follow [Cross-Industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) to deliver projects, which consists of 6 phases. More detailed breakdown of project structure and code examples can be found (here). 

### Business Understanding
First step is to define business needs of end users of the project and sucess criteria. This phase includes gathering requirements, stakeholders interviews, defining vision and user stories for product and use cases for models. This phase is closely aligned with GitLab's [OKRs] (https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/) and [iteration] (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration)
### Data Understanding 
This phase is not mutually exclusive to business understanding
### Data Preparation 
conducting [second data quality check] and [exploratory data analysis]. In this sectio
### Modeling 
a
### Evaluation 
Evaluation requires 
### Deployment  
If it is ad-hoc analysis then no production deployment is needed, only handover to end-users. 


# Success Criteria, Exit Criteria, Acceptance Measures, Goals, and Value Measures.
Every project starts and ends with success criteria.
