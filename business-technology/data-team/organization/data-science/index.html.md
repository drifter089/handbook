# Data Science at GitLab

The mission of the Data Science team is to help understand business, customers and products better with model-based insights that are trusted and scalable.

We do this by building model

## Tools 

Currently, Data Science team uses Python and Jupyter to deliver projects. 

# Data Science responsibilities

Additionally, the **Data Science Team** supports the following responsibilities
- With the **Data Leadership Team**:
    - Defining and publishing a Data Strategy to help maximize the value of GitLab's Data Assets
    - Broadcasting regular updates about data deliverables, ongoing initiatives, and upcoming plans
- With the [**Data Engineering Team**](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/organization/engineering/#data-engineering-responsibilities):
    - Building and maintaining the company's central Enterprise Data Warehouse to support Reporting, Analysis, Dimensional Modeling, and Data Development for all GitLab teams
    - Developing Data Management features such as master data, reference data, data quality, data catalog, and data publishing
    - Providing Self-Service Data capabilities to help everyone leverage data and analytics
    - Helping to define and champion Data Quality practices and programs for GitLab data systems

# Projects structure
Data Scientists follow [Cross-Industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) standard to deliver projects, which consists of 6 steps. More detailed breakdown of project structure and code examples can be found (here). 

### Business Understanding
Gathering requirements, defining vision for product and use cases for models, define success criteria. These need to be aligned with GitLab's [OKRs] (https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/)
