# Data Science at GitLab

The mission of the Data Science team is to help understand business, customers and products better with model-based insights.

We do this by building machine learning models and analysing data to convert results into trusted and scalable products.

## Tools 

Data Science team uses Python and Jupyter to deliver projects. 

# Data Science responsibilities

Responsibilities of data scientists are outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/finance/data-science/) 

Additionally, the **Data Science Team** supports the following responsibilities
- With the **Data Leadership Team**:
    - Defining and publishing a Data Science roadmap to expand analytical capabilities
    - Broadcasting regular updates about data deliverables, ongoing initiatives, and upcoming plans
- With the [**Data Engineering Team**](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/organization/engineering/#data-engineering-responsibilities):
    - Helping to define and champion Data Quality practices and programs for GitLab data systems

# Projects structure
Data Scientists follow [Cross-Industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) to deliver projects, which consists of 6 phases. More detailed breakdown of project structure and code examples can be found (here). 

### Business Understanding
First step is to define business needs of end users of the project and success criteria. This phase includes gathering requirements, stakeholders interviews, defining vision, user stories for product and use cases for models. This phase is closely aligned with GitLab's [OKRs] (https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/) and company's value - [Iteration] (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration)
### Data Understanding 
Data understanding is closely aligned with business understanding. It requires to define data sources that business already has in place and the ones that business does not. In this phase data scientists work closely with data engineers and data analysts to define any miscrepancies and risks. If there is a need to bring external data, request should be raised in this phase. 
### Data Preparation 
After defining business needs and data sources it is time to dive into data! This phase requires conducting [Second data quality check] and [Exploratory data analysis]. At this stage data scientists are gathering greater understanding of data what will be useful in next phase.
### Modeling 

### Evaluation 
Evaluation requires 
### Deployment  
Once success criteria has been met, If it is ad-hoc analysis then no production deployment is needed, only handover to end-users. 


# Success Criteria
Every data science project at GitLab starts and ends with success criteria.
