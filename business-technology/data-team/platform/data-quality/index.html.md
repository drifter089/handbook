## Overview

In an effort to improve Data Quality at GitLab, the Central Data Team is conducting a Design Spike on a Data Quality program. The approach is to develop a MVC around steps the Data Community can take to improve data quality while we wait upon a new Data Quality Manager to be hired. This handbook page will document the MVC and provide team members with guidance on how they can contribute to improved data quality at GitLab.
