## Sisense Dashboards

[Sisense](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/periscope/) is our enterprise standard BI tool. 

`IMPORTANT: 2021-09-08 SAFE Dashboard Changes`

**On 2021-09-08 Sisense dashboard access will be changing, driven by GitLab's maturation and the [SAFE Data Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/). The following section describes the planned access process.**

Access to Sisense dashboards is based on job role and goverened by the [SAFE Data Access Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/). In Sisense, dashboards are classified into the following spaces:
- the **SAFE Dashboard** space houses all dashboards that meet [GitLab's SAFE criteria](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#safe-flowchart). SAFE Dashboards are available to GitLab Team Members based on job role or demonstrated need.
- the **GitLab** space is a General Access area which houses all dashboards which do not require SAFE handling. General Access Dashboards are accessible by all GitLab Team Members.

A complete list of Dashboards, including SAFE Dashboards, is available in the [GitLab Dashboard Index](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/910238/GitLab-Dashboard-Index).

### Accessing a GitLab General Access Dashboard

General Access Dashboards are available to all GitLab Team members and no Access Request issue is required. Access instructions are covered in the [Sisense overview and development page.](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/periscope/#access)

### Accessing a SAFE Dashboard

All SAFE Dashboards are stored within the Sisense SAFE Dashboard space and access is granted at the Sisense space level. Access to a single SAFE Dashboard provides access to all SAFE Dashboards. Access to a SAFE Dashboard (and the space) requires:
1. Your immediate manager's approval
2. Departmental VP (or equivalent) approval
3. Approval of the SAFE Dashboard Space Owner defined in the GitLab Dashboard Index

To gain access to SAFE Dashboards:

1. Create an [Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com\team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues\new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request) and list up to three SAFE Dashboards from the [GitLab Dashboard Index](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/910238/GitLab-Dashboard-Index) you require access to. This list of SAFE Dashboards will help approvers understand your needs and intent.
2. Request approval from your immediate manager, your Departmental VP (or equivalent), and the SAFE Space Owner defined in the GitLab Dashboard Index header. Approval is **not needed**, if you have an approval for SAFE Data [access](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/#warehouse-access) in Snowflake, that is not older than 60 days. Skip this step and link to the particular AR. 
3. Once the request is approved, tag @gitlab-data/analysts and the Data Team will process the request.
4. After processing is complete you will be able to login to Sisense and access your requested SAFE dashboard and all other dashboards within the SAFE Dashboard Space.

Please see the [Accessing](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/#warehouse-access) SAFE Data in Snowflake for instructions on to access the SAFE data in Snowflake.

SAFE Data in Google Sheets files can be accessed using the instructions for [Accessing a SAFE Dashboard](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/#accessing-a-safe-dashboard). Please follow those instructions to gain access to SAFE Data in Google Sheets.
