## Introduction

This page lists GitLab self-service [analytics Workflows](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/#analytics-workflow) and [data definitions](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/#data-definition), collectively known as **The Data Catalog**. This single source of truth for trusted [self-service data](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/direction/self-service/) is organized by function and maintained within the Data Team handbook. In cases where a subject crosses functional boundaries, content will reside alongside the function that owns the source system of record. For example, consider Product SKUs, although many groups may use this data to make decisions, the documentation will live in Finance because Zuora is the SSOT for SKUs.

### Analytics Workflow

An _Analytics Workflow_ is a routine activity undertaken to analyze the performance of a well-defined business process. A given business process will likely have one or more supporting Analytics Workflows. As an example, the Marketing Lead Generation business process might include analytics workflows for Email Campaign Performance Analytics, Lead Qualification Analytics, and Pipeline Generation Analysis. Analytics Workflows are purposefully designed with established business processes in mind.

#### Analytics Workflow Development

1. Create a merge request to add the Analytics Workflow definition to the the appropriate section of the Data Catalog.
1. Define the Analytics Workflow page as completely as possible with all of its parts based on the [Level 2 Reference](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/direction/reference/).
1. Self-Service Development is considered complete once all key parts are operationalized, a Knowledge Assessment is published, and the Self-Service entry on this page is tagged with the appropriate [operational status](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/#legend).

### Data Definition

The Data Definition is a standard definition and set of use cases used as part of an Analytics Workflow.

#### Data Definition Development Workflow

1. Create a merge request to add the Data Definition to the appropriate section of the Data Catalog. If a Data Definition is part of an existing Subject Area page, only add a link to it from the Data Catalog Index and do not create a new stand-alone page with the Definition.
1. Define the Data Definition page as completely as possible with all of its parts, including a business summary and links to source systems of record and dashboards.
1. Data Definition is considered complete once all key parts are defined and the entry on this page is tagged with the appropriate [operational status](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/#legend).
