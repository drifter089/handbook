##  Welcome to the Data Programs Page

The Data Programs page contains information about the various programs we support, ranging from onboarding to day-to-day operations.

## Show-n-Tell and Demos

Data & Analytics Demos are a great way for everyone involved in the Data Program to share progress, innovation, collaborate, and just have fun. Data & Analytics Demos are [held every Thursday](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=Z2Zibm5rbWZvamptajYwOGs4dWI2ODk0c2tfMjAyMTA5MTZUMTUwMDAwWiBnaXRsYWIuY29tX2Q3ZGw0NTdmcnI4cDU4cG4zazYzZWJ1bzhvQGc&tmsrc=gitlab.com_d7dl457frr8p58pn3k63ebuo8o%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL) and recordings are posted to the [GitLab Unfildered Data Team playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KrRVTZY33WEHv8SjlA_-keI). 

## Data Science AMAs

The Data Science Team regularly holds AMAs to help spread awareness of Data Science and initiatives. Check out the [AMA with GitLab Data Scientists Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C5odZ14Fbnbb5uqNnrJsDnYQR_ZrvfPQCQ43xUEZsJY/edit) to learn more.

## Data Onboarding

If you are onboarding to GitLab and will be working in the Data Program as an Engineer, Analyst, or Developer, follow these steps:

1. Open a new issue in [GitLab Data Analytics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues) with the `Data Onboarding` template.
1. Give the issue a descriptive name: `Your Name - Data Onboarding`
1. Assign the issue to your Manager to add/remove relevant content
