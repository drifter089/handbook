## Data Team Planning Drumbeat

Watch our [Planning Drumbeat Walkthrough Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esyP9AodVtk) on GitLab Unfiltered.

The Data Team Planning Drumbeat is a pre-set sequence that happens every quarter. The Planning Drumbeat follows GitLab's financial year/quarter structure. The Data Team Planning calendar is as follows:

![Planning Drumbeat](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/how-we-work/planning/Planning_Drumbeat.png) <br>
[link to orginal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hdJqCfDPR-LqTTRBy4JEQ-MbrL-RyNHzXaMzvsGWkSQ/edit#gid=0)

Milestone naming convention; Milestone FYxx-Qxx-MSxx. I.e. FY22-Q02-MS01 <br>
LT = Leadership Team (`@rparker2`, `@iweeks`, `@dvanrooijen2`, `@mlaanen`) <br>
DT = Data team (Product Fusion Team, GTM Fusion Team or Data Engineering Team)

The overall ambition is to **structure** why, when and what we are doing. 
- OKRs will lead to **why**
- Work breakdown will lead to **what**
- Milestone planning will lead to **when**

This top-down approach is leading, but not fully limited to the way we work. 


### Start of Quarter OKR Planning

The Data Team OKRs aspire to align with Business Technology OKRs, Finance Division OKRs, and CEO OKRs, thereby aligning with the OKRs of the Divisions we support. Due to the nature of the the technical and data infrastructure work required to develop and operate an Enterprise Data Warehouse this will not always be the case.

By the end of a FQ, the Data Team will outline all actions that are required to succeed with our KRs and in helping other teams measure the success of their KRs. We do this via an issue in which everyone lays out all the steps they anticipate for each of the relevant actions. This is a great time for the team to raise any blockers or concerns they foresee. These should be recorded for future reference.

These OKRs drive ~60% of the work that the central data team does in a given quarter.
The remaining time is divided between urgent issues that come up and ad hoc/exploratory analyses.

Examples of OKR alignment _in-action_ include:

1. [FY21-Q2 CEO](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/fy21-q2/) Objective 2, aligns to [Data Team Objective 2](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/business-ops/-/epics/80) for delivering automated data pipelines in support of Growth initiatives.
1. [FY21-Q2 CEO](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/fy21-q2/) Objective 3, KR4 and KR5 align to [Data Team Objective 1](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/business-ops/-/epics/79) to deliver a Finance ARR Data Mart.

### OKR Structure and Setup

Data Team OKRS originate in the [GitLab-Data Group Project](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-data/). Once these OKRs have been reviewed by the Data Team and signed-off by Business Partner stakeholders, the top 3 Objectives and top 3 KRs for each are published into the [Business Technology Group Project](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/business-technology/) for sharing with the broader Business Technology Team, Finance Team, and others.

#### How To Setup Data Team OKRs

1. Create a new Epic in the [GitLab-Data Group Project](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-data/) with the title `DRAFT: FYxx-Qx Data Team Objectives and Planning Drumbeat`
      - Reference this [FY23-Q1 Data Team Objectives and Planning Drumbeat](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-data/-/epics/443) as an example
2. Create 1 linked Issue per Objective in the [GitLab-Data Managers Group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/managers)
3. Add detail to this Issue, including Direction, Teams Supported, Business Partners, and the Key Results each with their own Description.
4. Share the Epic to relevant business partners and stakeholders through the #data channel and @ mentions of the business partners to solicit review and feedback. All feedback should be added as comments into the top-level GitLab-Data Group Project Epic.

### End of Quarter OKR Review

During the OKR Review, the Data Leadership Team reviews the current status of the current FQ KRs. The results of the OKRs are evaluated and propagated to next FQ OKRs where applicable.

### Work breakdown

The outcome of the work breakdown is a detailed description of the work to be performed, deliverables and responsibilities in the next quarter and is determined by:
1. Defined upcoming OKRs 
2. OKR Review
3. New / forward looking insights 
4. Team availability
5. Team member ambitions

The work breakdown is team effort and everyone is encouraged to contribute.

#### T-Shirt Sizing Approach

We use a T-Shirt sizing approach for quickly sizing the work required to deliver new issues, epics, and longer-term initiatives. The T-Shirt sizing approach is designed to support work breakdowns towards the creation of detailed work plans, but also intended to provide a sufficient level of detail to manage overall scope.

| Size | Dedicated Person Time | Weight (issue points) | Examples | 
| :--: | :--: | :-- |
| XS | < 1/2 Day | 1 | Update existing handbook page. #data research/response. New Trusted Data Test.
| S | < 1 Day | 2-3 | New handbook page; typical triage issue; New dashboard on top of existing models. 
| M | 1 Week | 5-8 | New dashboard requiring new models. New data source with Stitch or Fivetran.
| L | 2-3 Weeks | 13 | New fact table implementation & testing. Full XMAU solution.
| XL | 1-2 Months | 26 | New Data Pump to new system. New Data Source with complex source API.
| XXL | 2-4 Months | 52+ | New Dimensional Model subject area with New Data Sources.


### Milestone Planning

The data team works in two-week intervals, called milestones. 1 milestones per quarter will take three weeks long, because a quarter contains 13 weeks. The milestone that takes 3 weeks is the milestone that covers a major holiday or if the majority of the team is on vacation or at Contribute. Milestones start on Wednesdays and end on Tuesdays. This discourages last-minute merging on Fridays and allows the team to have milestone planning meetings at the top of the milestone.

Milestone planning should take into consideration:

- vacation timelines
- conference schedules
- team member availability
- team member work preferences (specialties are different from preferences)


The timeline for milestone planning is as follows:

- Meeting Preparation - Responsible Party: Milestone Planner
    - Investigate and flesh out open issues.
    - Assign issues to the milestone based on alignment with the Team Roadmap.
    - Note: Issues are not assigned to an individual at this stage, except where required.

#### Goal of Planning Drumbeat

The goal of this process is to improve our ability to plan and estimate work through better understanding of our velocity.
During the milestone planning process, we assign [issue points](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/how-we-work/#issue-pointing), which are a good measure of consistency, as milestone over milestone should share an average.
Then we pull into the milestone based on when we think we can commit to the work being completed.
Then issues are prioritised according to our [standing priorities](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/how-we-work/#standing-priorities).

People will likely be working on no more than 2 issues at a time.

This approach has many benefits, including:

1. It helps ensure the highest priority projects are being completed
1. It can help leadership identify issues that are blocked
1. It provides leadership view into the work of the data team, including specialty analysts whose priorities are set from outside the data function
1. It encourages consistent throughput from team members
1. It makes clear to stakeholders where their ask is in priority
1. It makes clear to all team where their duty is in priority
1. It helps alleviate the pressure of planning the next milestone, as issues are already ranked

**The Planning drumbeat and execution is team-effort**
