## Technology Days

Let's discover new technologies through conversation, collaboration, demonstration, and instruction based on professional experiences and current projects being worked on within our department. As a participant you will have an inside track on thought-leadership, trends, and practical experience. During our cross-team social and technical sessions running once a month, we will get to understand the challenges other teams experience and collaborate on solving them.

Nest.js Framework. 
    **Lead by:** Integrations team Daniel Parker and Karuna Singh.
