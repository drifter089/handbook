# <i class="fas fa-newspaper" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Who We Are

The **Enterprise Applications Team** implements and supports specialized applications that support our business processes within GitLab.

We are directly responsible for all of GitLab's finance systems and Enterprise Applications Integrations.  We build and extend these applications to support the processes of our business partners and rationalize our application landscape to ensure it is optimized for efficiency and spend.

Our team ensures the availability of these applications and integrations through monitoring and alerting. These internal-facing applications include a multitude of different applications and environments, including Zuora, Adaptive Planning, Netsuite, Expensify, and etc. (tech stack).  Also we are responsible for the IT Audit and Compliance function to ensure we pass SOX Audit for our IT General Controls (ITGC).

# <i class="fas fa-tasks" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Vision

- To enable end to end business processes within the enterprise applications that seamlessly hand off to each other and ensure it provides a great user experience to our business partners
- Ensure data integrity between systems  and security of that data
- Constantly iterate to simplify and ensure processes are efficient and automated as much as possible..
- Leveraging out of the box best practices as much as possible. We buying and extend applications where we don't see building them as GitLabs core engineering competency
- IT Audit and Compliance - Ensuring that all customer / business data is secure and can pass key audits for attestations and compliance with SOX, SOC, etc.
