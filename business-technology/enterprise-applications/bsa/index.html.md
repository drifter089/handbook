## What Do We Do?
Being business process first, means that the Business Systems Analysts will firm up requirements, use cases and process flows as we implement systems, enhance them or deliver fixes. In a project, the BSA will assist with Business Process Mapping, gap analysis, project scoping, planning, and scheduling.
The Business Systems Analysts are also skilled to manage implementations by working closely with cross-functional business and vendor teams to implement Enterprise Applications that are coming on board. They follow a process that ensures we keep multiple groups aligned as we iterate to get the systems up quickly and efficiently.

### System Implementations
We often assist on the roll-out of new applications and systems. This involves vendor evaluations, current state documentation. In the past, we have worked on implementations of:
* Coupa
* DocuSign
* Zuora Revenue

### Business Process Enhancements
We partner closely with business stakeholders to help them improve existing business processes and help to design new ones. Some examples of business processes we have worked on include:
* 

### Bug Fixes
We have high level views of the enterprise application ecosystem and can help troubleshoot where a business process has broken down or a system flow is not working as expected.

## What Can We Help With?

As mentioned in the _What Do We Do_ section, the Business Systems Analysts can be involved in different areas from Business Analysis to Implementation Management. The main tasks that a BSA is skilled to lead and/or assist are listed below, together with the artefacts that can be used to support our engagement with our clients:

### Project-related tasks

#### Project Kick-off

A BSA can help the Project Team to organize, schedule and prepare a project kickoff meeting. This is the first meeting between a project team and the client or sponsor when kicking off a new project. It’ll take place after contracts have been signed and there’s agreement on the Statement Of Work (SOW), costs and timeline. Leverage the presence of a BSA to introduce the team, understand the project background, understand what success looks like, understand what needs to be done and agree on how to work together effectively.
> Project Kickoff meeting deck template [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jpe-rgBroH1CGz7WXeCl1UISIrTLXDT44UjjVNPnQFk/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Executive Steering Committee meetings

A Steering Committee is a form of corporate governance made up of high-level executives, authorities or stakeholders who provide strategic oversight and guidance to one or more projects within an organization. When these people meet, it’s called a Steering Committee Meeting. A BSA can host these meetings to assist with general guidance of the project and instructing the project/programme manager.
> Executive Steering Committee meeting template [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15dlUzy5qszw34MTTKZPnoye0P_R7vpeOv9PKlaihaMw/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Status Report

Status reports are timely updates on the progress of a project. They answer the questions everyone seems to be asking (before they actually ask them). Written concisely, they offer high-level information about a project, rather than every detail. BSAs can help the team build and schedule those as well as create a Geekbot automated report that will send the necessary information directly to a project slack channel.
> Weekly Status Report template [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19FjcV_PYuT7L182HSw35c33T4L7muWf52i4-7gLmrF0/edit?usp=sharing).<br>
> Geekbot stand ups guide [here](https://geekbot.com/blog/daily-standup-meeting/).

#### RAID Log

RAID is an acronym that stands for Risks, Actions, Issues and Decisions. A RAID log is a project management tool that tracks these risks, actions, issues and decisions. It’s a simple way to organize this information and comes in handy during meetings and project audits. A BSA can help keeping the RAID log updated by engaging with the necessary stakeholders to action on their tasks.
> RAID Log template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YeG_DO-EuR_hljl6BxSeQx_22htcjz6UKOInhecHncE/edit?usp=sharing).

#### User Stories

A User Story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer. Leverage the assistance of a BSA to collect ant track those.  

**How to create User Stories?**<br>

User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows:

“As a [type of user], I [want to], [so that].”
{: .alert .alert-info}

- _Type of user:_ Who are we building this for? Describes who will benefit from this function. Notice that the role is not simply “the user.” There are different types of users and so we want the role to be more specific than “user” but describe the type of user that will benefit from the story."
- _Want to:_ Describes their intent, not the features they use. What is it they’re actually trying to achieve? This statement should be implementation free — if you’re describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point."
- _So that:_ How does their immediate desire to do something like this fit into their bigger picture? What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving?"

> User Stories template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17AGafZAEOCdZTPIxy4mgrGlNAJ2Bo7NWjLkPebwnFY8/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Requirements

Requirements are conditions or capabilities that are required to be present in a product, service or result to satisfy a contract or other formally imposed specification. The purpose of stakeholder requirements is to describe the needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group. Leverage the assistance of a BSA to collect and track those.

> Requirements template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nylZN30o8urNj77JnmIRLpjgY7gbf0JR2IOPx8JRYAo/edit?usp=sharing).

#### UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and CRP (Conference Room Pilot)

The purpose of the CRP is to validate a software application against the business processes of end-users of the software, by allowing end-users to use the software to carry out typical or key business processes using the new software. UAT however, verifies whether the software works for the user (i.e. whether the user accepts how the software solves a problem). BSAs can help with documenting and prioritizing any issues resulting from testing, so it can be resolved by the appropriate party.

## How We Work

### Projects - Mark Quitevis

### Rolly
[Rolly](handbook/business-technology/how-we-work/rolly/) is a program status rollup automation tool and the BSAs use it to extract key status information from their current project epics and compile them into one issue [every week](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/business-technology-ops/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all&label_name%5B%5D=EntApps-weekly-rollup). This issue is then used in different meetings to cover project statuses, what's in progress and what is blocked.

### Labels
Labels help us organize and tag our work so we can track and find the work items we’re interested in.
