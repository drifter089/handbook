## What Do We Do?
Being business process first, we focus on requirements, use cases and process flows in order to help implement new systems, enhance existing processes or deliver fixes. On a project, our role includes requirements documentation, business process mapping, gap analysis, project scoping, timeline planning, and scheduling.
We also manage relationships by working closely with cross-functional business and vendor teams to implement new enterprise applications that are coming on board. In doing so, we follow a process that ensures we keep multiple groups aligned as we iterate to get the systems up quickly and efficiently.

### System Implementations
We often assist on the roll-out of new applications and systems. This involves vendor evaluations, current state documentation. A few systems we have recently implemented are:
* Coupa
* DocuSign
* Zuora Revenue

### Business Process Enhancements
We partner closely with business stakeholders to help them improve existing business processes or help to design new ones. This involves identifying points of failure, inefficiencies and manual work in our stakeholder's activities that could be improved through automation or other tools. We also intake change requests from stakeholders that require smaller systems improvements.

### Bug Fixes
We have high level views of the enterprise application ecosystem and can help troubleshoot where a business process has broken down or a system flow is not working as expected.

## How Can You Contact Us?
**Slack Channel:** `#enterprise-apps`    
**Slack Tag:** `@bsa`   
**GitLab:** You can also tag the Business Systems Analysts Team in GitLab using `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa`

## How We Work
EntApps works to ensure GitLab’s Order-to-Cash (OTC) lifecycle is as efficient as possible, supporting our internal business teams and applications involved throughout the OTC process. This includes working with teams such as Sales, Sales Ops, Billing, Procurement and Finance to understand and build solutions for their business problems. To do this, we partner with other technical teams and application owners within the OTC process, such as Engineering and Sales Systems. 

EntApps works to resolve business issues using a 4 stage process: discover, build, test, and deploy.  More information about the 4 stages can be found in the Phase Exit Criteria section.

### Intake
Open a request for the Enterprise Applications team by using the “Request” template under the [Enterprise Application Group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps) | [Intake Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues).

On a weekly basis, the Enterprise Applications Business Systems Analyst (BSA) will review all [open unassigned Intake Issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/boards/2798638?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&assignee_id=None) and assign them to a specific BSA to perform Discovery duties. Additional information will be requested in the Issue.

Depending on the complexity and urgency of the request, the BSA will either track work and provide updates directly in the Issue or create a project Epic to properly manage more-intricate requests.  The same phases, discussed below, are followed for both Intake Requests and Project Epics.

#### Project Epics
The Enterprise Application BSA team is responsible for creating project Epics and ensuring that they are regularly updated at each stage of the project. Projects consist of 5 Epics and a change management Issue. A single parent Epic is created with 4 children Epics that represent each phase of the project

![projects](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/bsa/onboarding/projects.png)

### Phase Exit Criteria
#### Discover
During Discovery, EntApps conducts independent research and meets with business stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the business problem.  We then compile and cleanse detailed business requirements.  Finally, before beginning solution design, we request approval sign-off from key stakeholders to ensure business requirements are accurate and all-inclusive.

- Requirements documented and approved by business partners
- Main project Epic Rolly updates
- Change management Issue drafted
- Re-evaluation and update of project dates
- Finance System Admin, Enterprise Applications Integration Engineer, or Business Partner Engagement
- EntApps Roadmap Update

#### Build
In the Build phase, EntApps collaborates with other stakeholders to develop solutions that meet the business requirements but also that are scalable and aligned with best-practices.

- Test scripts documented on QA/UAT Epic
- Main project Epic Rolly updates
- Solution documentation complete
- Change management Issue completed and approved by business partners
- Re-evaluation and update of project dates
- EntApps Roadmap Update

#### QA/UAT
EntApps collaborates with other stakeholders to develop test scripts and facilitates the user acceptance testing process.

- UAT signoff by business partners
- Deployment checklist documented and socialized with business partners
- Main project Epic Rolly updates
- Re-evaluation and update of project dates
- EntApps Roadmap Update

#### Deploy
EntApps owns developing a deployment plan and collaborating with other implementation teams to ensure completeness. This involves launch plans, user enablement, and go-live communications.

- Deploy announcement
- Handbooking
- Hyper care
- EntApps Roadmap Update

### Rolly
[Rolly](handbook/business-technology/how-we-work/rolly/) is a program status rollup automation tool and the BSAs use it to extract key status information from their current project epics and compile them into one issue [every week](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/business-technology-ops/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all&label_name%5B%5D=EntApps-weekly-rollup). This issue is then used in different meetings to cover project statuses, what's in progress and what is blocked.

### Labels
Labels help us organize and tag our work so we can track and find the work items we’re interested in.

#### Labels used by the BSAs

| Label | Description | Project/Group |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |

| ~"BT-Priority::2" | Important not urgent | gitlab-com, gitlab-org |
| ~"BT-Priority::3" | No rush to do, but please do it | gitlab-com, gitlab-org |
| ~"BT Finance Systems" | For anything related to a Finance System (i.e. Zuora, Netsuite, Tipalti, Expensify, etc.). Catch all to ensure a Finance Systems Admin is aware and can triage as necessary. | gitlab-com, gitlab-org |

The purpose of engagement meetings is to focus on Roadmap Prioritization, Issues, Risks and Decisions.

Decisisons and timing are recorded in a shared Decision Log to ensure that there is clarity and decision are properly documentated (Prioritization).

**How we operate**:<br>
1. Meetings are lead by function leaders and have a bi-weekly or less frequent cadence.
