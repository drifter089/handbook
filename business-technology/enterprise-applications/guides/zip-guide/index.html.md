### How to comment on a request?

Every request detail page includes a `Comments` tab that provides a space for communication between all users who can access the request. In addition to comments from members of the organization, this tab provides notifications when comments are left by vendors on the vendor portal. 
An user can post a question or comment, and all of the stakeholders in the chain (the requester and all approvers) will be notified to view and then respond, or `@` tag a specific person and only that person will get notified.
