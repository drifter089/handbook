## How to request the creation or modification of a SKU

We use issues to log requests related to SKUs. There are 4 templates that the user can choose from to help logging their request.

Two things that you need to have in consideration when choosing your template:
- If the request is for a Professional Services SKU.
   - If it is, make sure to select the correct template (it should be either `New_PS_SKU` or `Retiring_PS_SKU`). 
- The request type.
   - If you're requesting a new SKU, updating an existing one or retiring it.
