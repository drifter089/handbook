## Introduction

On this page, we're curating a list of questions that we at GitLab appreciate hearing answers to from others in remote organizations. We'll also address a popular question: "How do you interview remotely?"

## How do you interview remotely?

Whether you're wanting to learn how to hire remotely, or just wanting to know how to get hired for a remote position, it helps to know how you should prepare for a remote interview. You only get one chance to make a first impression, so keep these tips in mind.

## How do I assess culture fit remotely?

For hiring teams, a common challenge is this: "How do I assess culture fit remotely?"

To answer this question, you first need to unlearn a bit, and change your frame of mind. A hiring manager should *not* aspire to assess culture fit. Rather, you should aspire to assess *values fit*. 

For many, it is assumed that culture is simply the aura, energy, or vibe one gets when walking into an office. This is largely driven by decor and personas in the room. It is dangerous to allow company culture to be dictated by such factors, as this will create an oscillating culture that changes depending on mood or socioeconomic conditions. 

A company culture is a company's list of values. Culture is an assurance that each employee respects, admires, and feels invested in a company's values, and that leadership works to ensure values are not violated. As GitLab, a sub-value within our Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging  value is "[culture fit is a bad excuse](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#culture-fit-is-a-bad-excuse)."

Remote interviewers should link a company's values during the interview and have a conversation to assess a candidate's alignment and understanding of those values. Particularly in a remote setting, [values](/handbook/values/) serve as the north star, guiding every business decision by people you cannot physically see and shaping how colleagues treat one another. 

### Hiring managers/recruiters/interviewers/etc.

Conducting a remote interview is all about preparation, and most importantly, setting expectations for the person being interviewed. You also have technical considerations to make since the person joining the video/conference call is using a different setup than you, or they may not have interviewed remotely before. Be clear about how to join the interview and the technical requirements. Make sure the process and/or email templates are documented internally so that others can communicate this process to future interviewees.

1. **Specify if it is a phone or video interview.** Nothing can derail the interview faster than being caught offguard. Communicate this ahead of time.
1. **Give instructions for how to connect to the video call.** Include download instructions for the software you're using or a step-by-step guide if connecting from the web.
1. **Give the candidate an outline.** The team at [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/employer-blog/best-practices-conducting-remote-interviews/) recommends an outline with an interview start time, the name of the interviewer and anyone else they will be meeting, and the general order of events so they know when to speak.
1. **Have a practice meeting.** Use this opportunity to make sure your audio and video is coming through clearly.
1. **Have questions prepared and in front of you ahead of time.** Owl Labs has prepared [this list of remote questions](https://www.owllabs.com/blog/remote-job-interview-questions) if you need some inspiration.
1. **Share the process and documentation with others.** Make templates and processes available to other interviewers so that everyone communicates effectively.

### How to prepare for a remote job interview

Remote interviews are similar to in-person interviews in many ways: You're still trying to make a good impression and communicate your strengths, you're just not doing it from the same room. One of the ways that remote interviews can go wrong is if you don't take into account your environment and let yourself become distracted. Preparation is just as important in a remote interview as an in-person interview.

1. **Read instructions from your interviewer carefully (and ask questions if something is unclear).** Make sure that you understand the requirements for the interview and make sure to download any programs and test ahead of time.
1. **Have a distraction-free area for the interview, if possible.** Background noise or clutter can take attention away from you, which is not what you want.
1. **Make eye contact.** Look into the camera as much as possible, not the screen. 
1. **Have a practice meeting.** Try to download any software for a video call far enough in advance to test your audio and video settings.
1. **Don't casually browser the internet on your computer during an interview.** If you wear glasses, the other person may be able to see what is on your screen and that can be a little embarrassing. Only have what you need for the interview and don't get distracted.
1. **Use headphones with a microphone.** Not only will this make you sound better, it will reduce listening fatigue for the other person as well so that you can have a better conversation. One of the more common phrases you'll hear from GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij is, "[Can you put your headphones on?](/blog/2019/06/28/five-things-you-hear-from-gitlab-ceo/)"

## Interview questions to assess for success in a remote environment

1. Have you ever worked remotely?
1. What were some of the challenges you faced with working remotely?
1. Why do you want to work from home or a third-space (e.g. coworking space, external office, [Codi](https://www.codi.com/), etc.)?
1. Have you worked with a distributed team? How did it go? Even if it wasn't explicitly defined as remote work, you can include examples of moving a project forward while traveling, or doing so while your classmates, peers, or colleagues were in a different physical location.
1. What methods do you use to ensure you are communicating with a remote team?
1. How do you switch off from work?
1. Tell me about a time you recognized an opportunity for process improvement and how you brought that up to leadership.
1. Have you ever worked independently without direct supervision on a daily basis?
1. What strategies, tools, routines, or workflows do you use to ensure your day to day goals met?
1. What are some of the things that you have struggled with or you think you will struggle with working remotely and how do you intend to combat them?
1. What excites you about working remotely over working in a traditional office environment?
1. What would you do if you have a piece of work that requires someone in a different timezones help and they are not available?

GitLab seeks to learn from others who are embracing remote work. This list of questions is directed at other peers working within a remote organization. Some are aimed at executives and hiring managers. In the video above, found on the [GitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A), Sid asks the below questions to InVision Chief People Office Mark Frein.

## GitLab All-Remote Snapshot interviews

GitLab's all-remote culture empowers team members to [live and work where they are most fulfilled](/company/culture/all-remote/people/), and to structure their day in a manner that suits them. 

If you have yet to work within an all-remote environment, it can be difficult to fully understand the potential. Each individual is [able to approach all-remote differently](/company/culture/all-remote/people/), leveraging the autonomy it enables to improve one's life.

*In the [GitLab Unfiltered video](https://youtu.be/QTPeyRW766Q) above, two GitLab team members share their experiences on working in an all-remote setting, providing a glimpse at what's possible when embracing this style of work.*

To provide insight and [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency) into the lives of GitLab team members — and give those considering remote work [ideas for structuring their own lives](/company/culture/all-remote/resources/#blogs-from-gitlab-team-members) — we ask the below questions in a video interview. While GitLab's entire team is remote, there can be great diversity in answers. 

1. Who are you, how long have you been at GitLab, and what do you do at GitLab?
1. What attracted you to GitLab?
1. Was all-remote a big contributor to why you chose to work at GitLab?
1. What notable elements of an all-remote culture have impacted how you structure your day and life?
1. Would you walk us through a typical day in your life?
1. If you were to give advice to someone considering working for an all-remote company, what would you tell them?
