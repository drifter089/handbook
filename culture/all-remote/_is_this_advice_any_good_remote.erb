Is this advice any good?

GitLab is one of the world's largest all-remote companies. We are 100% remote, with no company-owned offices *anywhere* on the planet. We have over 1,500 team members in more than 65 countries. The primary contributor to this article ([Darren Murph](/handbook/marketing/readmes/dmurph/), GitLab's Head of Remote) has over 15 years of experience working in and reporting on colocated companies, [hybrid-remote](/company/culture/all-remote/hybrid-remote/) companies, and all-remote companies of various scale. 

Just as it is valid to [ask if GitLab's product is any good](/is-it-any-good/), we want to be transparent about our expertise in the field of remote work.
