# Onboarding Processes

## Overview
This page is a guide for People Experience Associates when onboarding new team members. All onboarding tasks and guidelines for new team members, People Experience, and Managers are in the [People Experience Onboarding Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/employment-templates/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding.md). Each onboarding issue is structured with tasks for all team members (day 1 to day 5 and then week 2 to week 4) and below those task sections are listed department-specific and/or role-specific tasks.  In some cases, specific tasks may link to supplemental issues, created by specific teams, with in-depth training.
In case this is a re-hire ping the ITOps team in the #it-help slack channel to ensure there are no blockers, before creating an onboarding issue or any accounts to avoid the re-hire from having system related issues on day 1.

### Timing

On Monday and Wednesday the People Experience Associate in the `BHR Onboarding Report` [rotation](/handbook/people-group/people-experience-team/index.html#weekly-rotations) will [pull a report from BambooHR](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-experience-team/#pulling-of-bamboohr-onboarding-data) which compiles a list of all new team members starting in 2 weeks and added to the onboarding tracker. This data is pulled from the [Greenhouse <> BambooHR sync](/handbook/people-group/engineering/gh-bhr-sync/) once the Candidate Experience Specialist team updates the team member to `hired`.

In the event that a team member has already been synced and a new team members start date changes, it is **important** that the Candidate Experience Specialist team notifies the People Experience team by submitting a Slack form in order to re-sync the team member and update the necessary systems (Onboarding issue, PEA tracker, BambooHR, etc).

People Experience Associates will create the onboarding issue, and start completing the onboarding tasks, no later than 5 days before the new team member joins. People Experience Associates require a minimum of 4 business days (with the new hire timezone as the basis) before the new hire's start date to complete all onboarding tasks. To ensure we create a smooth onboarding experience for new team members, provide enough time for the IT Ops team for laptop orders, and completing the I-9 process (for US-base hires) 4 days is the minimum amount of time needed. Should a contract not be signed prior to 4 working days from the start date, a new start date will be required.

If any changes or updates need to be made to the onboarding template, kindly notify team members of the People Experience team by ccing them in the MR with the `@gl-people-exp` handle. Also notify other teams if a change will impact them.

All new hires will receive invitational access to their GitLab email, GitLab accounts, and any other work-related accounts on Day 1. No access is permitted before Day 1.

### Issue Organization
Labels Associated with Onboarding Issues

- **PE: Pre Start - Complete**
    - This label would be used when all of the Pre-Start Date Tasks have been completed.
- **PE: Day 1 - Complete**
    - This label would be used when all of the People Experience task for Day 1 have been completed.
- **PE: Pending - Day 1**
  - This label is used when the Day 1 task cannot be completed by the PEA Team.
- **PE: Pending - Pre Start**
    - This label would be used when the People Experience team needs to complete the steps prior to Day 1.
- **Encryption - Missing**
  - This will be added by the People Experience team if a new team member is missing the security tasks under Day 3.
- **Encryption - Complete**
  - This will be added by the team member or the People Experience team once all of the security tasks for encryption have been completed.
- **Manager: Pre Start Complete**
  - This is used when the new team members manager has completed all of the `Before Starting at GitLab` Manager Tasks.
- **Manager: Day 1 Complete**
  - This is used when the new team members manager has completed all of the `Accounts and Access` Day 1 - Manager Tasks.
- **Manager: Pending**
  - A manager can add this if they are working on a new team members profile but cannot complete all of the tasks.


### Alerts & Announcements
At 14:00 UTC every Wednesday, the `PeopleOps Bot` slack bot will send an alert in the `#people-connect-alerts` channel listing any data missing (if applicable) from the BambooHR profiles of team members joining the following week. The People Experience team will fill in these missing details as soon as possible since completeness and accuracy of BambooHR profiles is necessary for all automation.

At 10:00 UTC every Thursday, the bot will send another alert in the `#team-member-updates` channel with a list of all new team members joining the following week. This list includes names, email addresses, joining dates, and job titles of the new hires along with links to a Sisense graph showing the hiring progress over time. If any issues are detected by the bot, the post will first be submitted to the `#people-connect-alerts` channel, where the People Experience team will then rectify and rerun the bot (/pops run joiningannouncement) in Slack.

## Pre-Onboarding

### Converting from Consultant to Full Time Team Member

In some cases, consultants will be hired with GitLab and converted to full time team members. If this is the case, the following should take place:

- People Experience Associate should reach out to the manager in the onboarding issue once created to advise them that they need to complete an offboarding access request for the consultant as per this [process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/temporary-service-providers/#offboarding). The manager should then reach out to the IT Ops team to get it actioned and ensure that the new email address (which the People Experience Associates add to BambooHR) will sync correctly to Okta. 
- The People Experience Associate should also send a message to the manager in the issue to see whether a laptop has been sent to the team member, as well as that the team member will need to split focus between carrying on role based tasks and completing the onboarding issue.  

### Pre-Onboarding, US
- **I-9 and E-Verify**<a name="I-9"></a>

For all GitLab Inc. and GitLab Federal LLC US-based employees, GitLab complies with all USCIS requirements and laws, including the I-9 and E-Verify process. GitLab uses an online I-9 portal called LawLogix where the process is completed and documents are saved electronically and securely.

#### Timing of I-9

GitLab requests that team members complete the I-9 process at least two business days prior to their start date. Please note the `two business days prior to the new hire's start date` timeline pertains to GitLab's internal policy, not USCIS legal requirements. GitLab requires the process to be completed earlier than USCIS to ensure there is no delay in adding the new team member to payroll and other important systems.

If a GitLab team member has not completed Section 1 by end of day on their first day of work (their start date), all access is paused. Their Google Workspace is Suspended, as well as their Okta account, as well as their 1Password account and Slack account if these have been created. Access will be resumed as soon as Section 1 is completed.

If a GitLab team member has completed Section 1 but their Designated Agent has not completed Section 2 by the end of day of the team members fourth day of work (3 business days after start date), all access is paused. Their Google Workspace is Suspended, as well as their Okta account, as well as their 1Password account and Slack account. Access will be resumed as soon as Section 2 is completed.

_Note: You can reference what are considered to be “Acceptable Documents” [here](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents/acceptable-documents)._

#### Procedure

1. There is currently a [sync](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/miscellaneous/#team-members-to-lawlogix-i9) between BambooHR and LawLogix in place where a team member will automatically be added to LawLogix 7 days before their start date.

1. **Section 1** → Employee personal details. New team members fill out this section online personally.
1. **Section 2** → Employee assigns a “Designated Agent” to view, verify and document their government-issued official document(s). The Designated Agent completes this section online personally, but with the new team member and their documents physically in hand next to the Designated Agent.

**If a team member is synced from Greenhouse to BambooHR less than 7 days prior to their start date, we will manually need to run the [pops command](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/onboarding/#new-hires) to sync from BambooHR to LawLogix.

#### Sending of Employee Instructions

**All of the below is done automatically with the sync.** Action using the steps below is only needed when there is an error with the sync.

In the event that the automation fails, the **People Experience Associate** can run the command `/pops run uploadtoi9 bambooid` in Slack, which will then automatically add the new team member to LawLogix.

The **People Experience Associate** will complete the following steps:

1. Open Dashboard and locate the team members name.
1. Click on the team members name.
1. Then select the I-9 Forms tab
1. Click on the * next to `Electronic I-9`
1. Select who will be the responsible party (People Experience Associate)
1. Select `Review Employee Instructions`
1. Select insert the team members personal email and address and the select `Send or Edit Email`
1. Select `Send Email`
   - All email templates are [located here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/tree/master/.gitlab/email_templates)

#### Designated Agent Section

Once the team member has selected a designated agent and inserted the required information in the `GitLab I-9 Process - Designated Agent Info` google form, the People Experience Associate will log into LawLogix portal and follow the steps below:

1. Click on the team members name
1. Select the I-9 Forms tab
1. Click on the * next to `Electronic I-9`
1. Select `Review Agent Instructions`
1. Insert the designated agents email address in the To: field (as provided in the Google Form)
1. Select `Send or Edit Email`
1. Select `Send Email`

The new hire will complete section 1 of the I-9 and upload documents (optional at this step).

 - **Note**: LawLogix does not detect spelling errors, this will need to be reviewed by the PEA.

#### Approving the I9

[Helpful Guide](http://uploads.lawlogix.com/Training_I9/Tutorials/Remote_Hire_with_Agent.pdf) Slide 94 for Approving I-9

1. The new hire's name will show up on the dashboard under "I-9 needs approval"
1. Click on the `Date I-9 Created` Date (Not the name of the I-9)
    1. Review the I-9
    1. Open the Uploaded Documents
           - Review the I-9 to check for mistakes, as well as compare to any uploaded supporting documents by clicking the PDF icons. Editing is locked after it has been approved.
    1. If you find any error or issues following the steps [here](http://uploads.lawlogix.com/Training_I9/Tutorials/Edit_I9.pdf) to edit the I-9.
1. Click `Mark Approved` on the right side of the page
1. Select E-Verify Approval
1. Mark Approve
  - Review the Documents and Review Section 1 and 2 for errors
  - Delete any unnecessary documents uploaded by new hire or designated agent
1. Approve this I9 - This will now be pushed to E-Verify

#### E-Verify Photo Matching

[Guide](http://uploads.lawlogix.com/Training_I9/Tutorials/EV_Photo.pdf)

1. Once an I-9 has been approved and submitted to E-Verify, if Photo-Matching is required a new tab will appear - `Manual Processing`.
1. The photo returned by E-Verify will be displayed on the Manual Processing Tab.
1. Documents previously uploaded are available for review. Click on the appropriate link to compare the document to the image returned by E-Verify. (IE US Passport ID Page).
1. Compare the photos.
1. Select the appropriate response.
1. If the photos match you should receive an `Employment Authorized` result within 30 seconds.
1. Save the E-Verify PDF breakdown and upload to BambooHR to the team members `Verification` folder, along with the documents used to confirm identity.

#### Team member is no longer joining but I-9 process has started

In the event that a team member notifies us that they will no longer be joining GitLab but the I-9 initial email has been sent, the People Experience team will need to manually `terminate` the team member from LawLogix.

1. Click on the date of the I-9 for the team member.
1. Check that Section 1 has not yet been completed.
1. Select `Employee Details`
1. Click on `Terminate Employee`
1. Confirm the warning message that appears.
1. Refresh the dashboard and the team member should no longer be listed.

#### Citizenship Confirmation

For certain systems and applications, it is required for Administrators to confirm that team members are US Citizens to be given access to these systems.

1. Administrators can email `people-exp@gitlab.com` and ask for confirmation that a team member is a US Citizen.
1. Any People Experience Associate (PEA) can look in the Verification Docs folder in BambooHR for the specific team member, as that is where the documents used to complete the I-9 process are housed.
1. If the team member has an unexpired US Passport, the PEA may reply: "We can confirm that we have visual proof that this team member possesses an unexpired US Passport, a document only given to US Citizens, therefore they are a US Citizen."
1. If the team member has an expired US Passport, the PEA may reply: "We can confirm that we have visual proof that this team member possesses an expired US Passport. We will reach out to the team member for visual confirmation of an unexpired US Passport." Then, the PEA will reach out to the team member to gather the scan/image of an unexpired US Passport and then update the email thread.
1. If the team member has a US Birth Certificate, the PEA may reply: "We can confirm that we have visual proof that this team member possesses a US Birth Certificate, a document only given to US Citizens, therefore they are a US Citizen."
1. If the team member only has documents other than a US Passport or Birth Certificate, the PEA may reply: "The following team member only provided documents such as a Driver's License and Social Security Card (for example). Since these are available to non-citizens we cannot confirm their US citizenship." Then, the PEA will reach out to the team member to gather a scan/image of either an unexpired US Passport or Birth Certificate and update the email thread.
1. If the team member has a Permanent Resident Card, the PEA may reply: "I can confirm the team member has an unexpired permanent resident card. Is this acceptable for your system?"
    - Note: This document is not sufficient for SalesForce

### Pre-Onboarding, Japan
The PEA team will send two payroll forms for the new team member to complete. This enables our payroll provider to help with the Health Insurance registration.

1. At **least two weeks** before the team members start date, the PEA will send both forms listed below to the team member to complete.
- [Employee Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JilpntlWfBpi_7q6Ofz4P2R9EDGeIo8C/edit#gid=1243702652)
- [Application for change in exemption for dependents of employment income earner](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zQ0aYTeor59dszMfYH4j7D4a3OB8Z9_Q)
1. To complete the forms the PEA will
- Employee Regisration Form: Select make a copy and save in team members name. Use the hire date as the effective date
- Application for change in exemption for dependents: Download and email the form to the team members personal email address to complete.
- Be sure to use the hire date as the effective date
1. The PEA will be sure to cc `nonuspayroll@gitlab.com` in the email sent to the team member so that they can see action has been taken
1. Once both forms are completed, the PEA will save in BambooHR in the Payroll Folder

### Pre-Onboarding, South Korea
The PEA team will send two payroll forms for the new team member to complete. This enables our payroll provider to set up everything in anticipation of the team member starting. 

1. At **7 days** before the team members start date, the PEA will send both forms listed below to the team member to complete.
- [South Korea - Onboarding Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_TQ7A7gXZtIyvDMzF5xvJBbKM0fLvR_n/edit?rtpof=true#gid=1486314850)
- [South Korea - Documents Required](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zQ0aYTeor59dszMfYH4j7D4a3OB8Z9_Q)
1. To complete the forms the PEA will
- Onboarding Form: Select make a copy and save in team members name. Use the hire date as the effective date
1. The PEA will be sure to cc `nonuspayroll@gitlab.com` in the email sent to the team member so that they can see action has been taken

### Pre-Onboarding, Germany
The PEA team will send a sheet for the new team member to complete payroll forms. This enables our payroll provider to set up everything in anticipation of the team member starting. 

1. Send the new team member the [GTL008_Monthly_LPI_Template_Germany](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gBVDpk_mk2iGyfcrLEEhfUGtoMzDC3tb/edit#gid=1185395756) form before the start date. Remember to make a copy and save it in the team members name. Share this file with the `@nonuspayroll@gitlab.com` to have access. 
- [South Korea - Documents Required](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zQ0aYTeor59dszMfYH4j7D4a3OB8Z9_Q)

### Pre-Onboarding, UK
The PEA team will send two payroll forms for the new team member to complete. These forms enable our UK payroll provider (Vistra) to help with their new hire enrollment.

1. A few days before the new team members start date, the PEA will send both:
- The new team member the [UK email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/employment-templates/-/tree/master/email_templates).
  - This email contains: New Starter Checklist link, information about P45, and notification that UK payroll form will be sent from DocuSign
- Using DocuSign, send the new team member the UK payroll form.
  - To do this go to Template >> Use template >> GitLab Ltd Uk Payroll Form.
  - On the drop-down menu on the right, choose use template. Fill in as much information as possible from BambooHR and stage in DocuSign for signature using their personal email.
1. Once the payroll form has been completed and signed by the new team member file the document in BambooHR under Documents/Payroll Forms. If a New Starter Checklist was completed, save it in the same folder. If new team member has a P45, verify that the P45 is for the current tax year and please save it to BambooHR as well.
1. When the Payroll form and P45 or New Starter Checklist are complete, send as encrypted attachments to Vistra Payroll along with an encrypted copy of the team member's signed contract. The signed contract is found in the Contracts & Changes folder in the team member's BambooHR profile.
- This information should not be sent later than Day 1 of a new hire's start date. Do not cc the team as this is sensitive information. Once acknowledged, delete your email.
- Failure to provide the documents before week one will result in payroll and benefits delays

## Pre-Onboarding Issue Creation Tasks

The People Experience Associate will create the Google Mail account first.

#### **Google Mail Account Creation**<a name="Google"></a>

1. People Experience Associates create email addresses for new team members using the convention of `firstinitiallastname@gitlab.com`.
- Review common naming customs for the team member region. If the team member is from a [LATAM country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_customs_of_Hispanic_America), ensure the email address is aligned with the team members preferred first name and last name(s).
1. To make sure that we create the GitLab Google Mail account according to the new team member's preferred first and last name, we first look at the team member's resume & relevant communications to find their preferred name.
1. Before creating the email account, verify that the proposed email is not conflicting with a current account by searching in Google Workspace Admin. If it is, add a letter for their middle name or ask the team member for their choice in preferred letter addition to their email address. After confirming, check the email again within the Google Workspace Admin. **Please note that you will not be creating the email address in Google Workspace Admin**.
1. Add the email address to the BambooHR profile under work email. The Okta and BambooHR sync will then create the email address automatically in Google Workspace.

Examples:
  * If a team member's legal name is "Joseph D. Doe" but their application and emails are signed "Joe Doe", then we create the GitLab email as Joe Doe, `jdoe@gitlab.com`.
  * If a team member's legal name is "Nina Fernandez Kola" but their resume and emails are signed "Nina Fernandez", then we communicate with the team member in advance and create the GitLab email as `nfernandez@gitlab.com` with confirmation from them that is their preferred name.
  * If a team member's legal name is "Li Ju Zhang" but their resume and emails are signed "Joanna Zhang", then we communicate with the team member in advance and create the GitLab email as `jzhang@gitlab.com` with confirmation from them that is their preferred name.

#### **BambooHR Profile Data**

As part of the [Greenhouse<>BambooHR automation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/gh-bhr-sync/), certain fields in BambooHR are [pre-filled](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/gh-bhr-sync/#synced-fields). The People Experience Associate will check all synced fields have been populated correctly.

***Note:*** If all of the necessary tabs in the new team member's BambooHR profile do not automatically populate, please go to the `Job` tab, scroll down to the `Job Information` section, click the pencil icon on the righthand side of the section, and ensure that the `Department` and `Division` fields are correctly populated. Save your changes and refresh the new team member's profile. All necessary tabs should now appear. Please also create an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/employment-automation/-/issues/new?issuable_template=bug_with_greenhouse_bamboo_sync) for the People Group Engineer to [investigate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/gh-bhr-sync/) why the sync did not auto complete the fields.

#### Hire Date Changes

- If a new team member needs to adjust their start date but a new contract is not created, the People Experience team will:
1. Have the Candidate Experience Specialist team complete the following [steps](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/ces-contract-processes/#how-to-update-a-start-date-after-the-contract-is-signed).
1. Check all **Hire Dates** in BambooHR
1. Update the onboarding issue (if created)
1. Ensure the email with the updated start date is filed under the Contracts and Changes folder in BambooHR

- If a new team member start date falls on a holiday that is observed by the new hire or the People Experience Team:
1. The People Experience Associate will coordinate with the Candidate Experience Associate to adjust the start date to the next business day. Ensure the Hiring Manager is included in this communication.
1. The BambooHR dates will not be adjusted.
1. Update the Onboarding Issue title to reflect the "New Start Date". This date is used for the onboarding email automation.

#### New team member rejects offer

If a new team member has already been marked as hired in Greenhouse and the sync has taken place, then they reject our offer, the Candidate Experience team will notify both the VP, People Operations, Technology & Analytics and the People Experience team in the #people-group-confidential Slack channel.
1. Once confirmed, The People Experience Associate will verify that the profile has been deleted and then update the People Experience team onboarding tracker to remove the former team member.
1. If the deleted team member was located in the US, review and delete the relevant I-9 entry for them in LawLogix as per the deletion [process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/#team-member-is-no-longer-joining-but-i-9-process-has-started).

#### Personal Tab

1. **Name:**  Verify the team member's **full legal name** (as much as it is known before seeing legal ID) and preferred name if known has been added correctly as per the custom sync. The sync will import middle name as part of first name, you will need to seperate them if that was the case.
1. **Address:** Enter full address, including Street address, City, Region, Zip/Post Code and Country. Only the country is pre-filled by the custom sync. This data can be found in Greenhouse under the 'Details' section.
1. **Locality:** ([geo area](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#geographical-areas), country). This information should be visible in the offer details. If you have any questions, please reach out to the Total Rewards team.
  * Please note the formatting must be entered exactly as outlined in the [location factor file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/compensation-calculator/-/blob/master/data/location_factors.yml) with "area, country" or the integration outside BambooHR will fail. Please only choose a locality from the already created fields in BambooHR. Do not create any new localities.
1. **Region:** If not: the three options are Americas, EMEA, or JAPAC.
1. **Work Email** Add the GitLab email in the Work Email field. This can not be done by the sync, as the team member is synced before the email is created. Once added, this will sync from BambooHR to Okta and allow the team member to access their Google Mail via Okta.

#### Jobs Tab

1. **Hire Date:**
1. **Role:**
   * Leader - if director or above

  In the email, the People Experience Associate will include the information that is listed under the PIAA section of the contract and the next steps needed for approval, ie after approval adding their manager/director to the email thread for approval. 
  1. The manager will ask any necessary clarifying questions. Once the manager is comfortable providing written approval, they will then add the applicable Director-level leader to the thread, for their review and approval.
  1. If the Director feels additional review and approval is needed, the Director will add the next level (VP or C-level as appropriate) to the email thread. If not, the Director will respond indicating their approval.<br>
_Note: A minimum of direct manager and Director-level approval is required for all PIAA exceptions._
  1. The People Experience Associate will respond to the thread stating that they have saved the entire thread to the team member's BambooHR profile.
  1. The People Experience Associate will need to save this to the `contracts & Changes` folder in BambooHR. 
  1. More complicated requests that seem to show conflicts or projects involving a 1099 might require additional legal approval which will be coordinated by the Team Member Relations Specialists (teammemberrelations@gitlab.com), who may forward the thread to the Functional Leader, or both. Legal may also be added to conversation as needed.
  1. Once there is a final conclusion, the manager will relay the information to the team member. 
  1. The manager will then need to forward the email thread to the People Experience Associate who will save the entire thread as a pdf and filed in the team member's BambooHR record in the `Contracts and Changes` folder.

   * Enter No if the team member answered No or None.

1. **Candidate ID:** This is the candidate's ID in Greenhouse, and is found by looking at the URL for the candidate. It is an 11-digit number listed between /people/ and the ? symbol.
1. **GHP_ID:** This is the GHP ID in Greenhouse. You can find this on the approvals tab for the team member, then scroll to the `Openings` table and scroll to the far left to get the `GHP ID`.

**If any of the below information has not been correctly synced, rerun the sync. Alternatively, you can use the BambooHR calculator to verify the figures that need to be manually added**.
1. **Compensation Table:**
   * Compare the data to the signed offer in Greenhouse. Reach out to a Total Rewards Analyst if you need any assistance.
1. The **Pay Frequency** and the **Pay Schedule** should be filled in according to this table:

     - If the title does not exist, ping the `total-rewards` team in the private Slack channel `#people-connect_totalrewards` and verify the title is in the correct format before adding.
     - Once confirmed, scroll to the bottom, click "Add New", create and save the new job title.
   * **Reports To:**  Check that the manager listed on the contract is listed correctly in BambooHR.
   * **Job Title Speciality:**  If there is a specialty (this would be found under On Job-  Offer Details), this will be inserted in the field. If the specialty is not listed in the drop down menu, create a new one. The Job Title Specialty field has no restrictions)
         (Examples of a Specialty: Growth, Commercial, DoD, EMEA).<br>
  * Note: For Development, the `Job Title Specialty` field should indicate the `Group` level within Development (I.E. Package, Verify, Fulfillment, etc). For reference, there is an overview of all of the stages and their corresponding `Groups` on the [Product sections, stages, groups, and categories](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages) handbook page.

   * This will list either **Part Time or Full Time**, check whether this is listed correctly.
1. **Bonus**
   * Enter a bonus date, amount and type if applicable.

1. **Employment Status**
   * The Employment Status table will be filled out automatically depending on the [New Hire's country policies](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/entity_mapper.yml). It is important that the People Experience Associate verifies that the statuses have been added successfully.

   * New Team Members with entities that are not mentioned in [this file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/entity_mapper.yml).
        1. `Active` with the Hire Date as the Effective Date
   * New Team Members in the **Netherlands** should have 5 entries;
        1. `Temporary Contract` with effective date marked as the start date (add comment `12-month Temporary Contract (YYYY-MM-DD start date to YYYY-MM-DD end of Temporary Contract)` )
        1. `Temporary Contract Ending` with the date marked as exactly **12 months** from their start date (**Important**: For a 12-month contract with a March 4, 2019 start date, the end date would be March 3, 2020. Any following contract after this 12-month period would have a start date of March 4, 2020)
        1. `Probationary Period` with the date marked as the start date (add comment `1-month Probation Period (YYYY-MM-DD start date to YYYY-MM-DD end of Probation Period)` )
        1. `End of Probationary Period` with the date marked as exactly one **month** from their start date
        1. `Active` with the date marked as exactly **12 months and one day** from their start date (AKA: The day after the Temporary Contract ends)
        1. Example for team member starting June 12, 2020:

| Effective Date | Employment Status | Comment |
|----|----|----|
|2021-06-12| Active| |
|2020-06-12| Probationary Period| 1-month Probation Period 2020-06-12 to 2020-07-12|
|2020-06-12| Temporary Contract| 12-month Temporary Contract  2020-06-12 to 2021-06-11|
|2020-07-12| End of Probationary Period| |
|2021-06-11| Temporary Contract Ending| |

   * New Team Members from entities mentioned in [this file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/entity_mapper.yml)
        1. `Probationary Period` with the start date - Add a comment with the length of the probation period and the start to end date. This is helpful for the reminder emails.
        1. `End of Probation Period` with the number of months after start date.
        1. `Active` number of months + 1 day after start date.

1. If the team member is a member of the People Group, the People Experience Team is unable to view the probation status. Simply the run the following command in a private Slack message to confirm that the probation period statuses have been added successfully for the team member dependent on their location:
`/pops run probationstatus team member name or GitLab email address`.
        1. If the status is incorrect, the People Experience Associate will need to request assistance from the Total Rewards Analyst to update the status.
1. If applicable, Ensure the `End of Probation Period` date is accurate, this date will drive an alert for the People Experience team automatically, 5 days before and on the day the probation period expires. Details of the probation period process can be found on the [Contracts, Probation Periods & PIAA](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#probation-period) handbook page. Please use these probation periods in BambooHR for team  members in these specific groups.


#### Notes Tab

1. **Referrals** The sync can't add notes.
   * Add a Note stating "Referred by Jane Doe" if team member was referred. Search in multiple places in their offer details to make sure that you find information if they were referred.

Review the [Referral Process Page](/handbook/hiring/referral-process) for adding referral bonus.

_Note: In the case that a referral was not added or was incorrectly added to BambooHR, resulting in the bonus not being paid on time to the referring team member, please proceed with the following steps:_
   * If not already added, add the bonus to BambooHR as instructed above. For the `bonus date` section, the date that the referral bonus ***should have been paid out*** should be added (I.E. 3 months after the referred team member's start date).
   * Email both `payroll@gitlab.com` and `total-rewards@gitlab.com` to notify them of the change.


## Onboarding Issue Creation
The People Experience Associate will then create an onboarding issue with a ChatOps command in Slack 4-5 business days prior to the new team member's start date.

1. Before creating the onboarding issue, ensure that all information entered BambooHR is accurate and complete.
1. In Slack, go to your profile as if you were going to send a Slack message to yourself. Type the command `/pops run onboarding BambooHR_ID_number` (not Employee ID #). This number is found in the team member's BambooHR profile URL, after `id=`. It is a 5-digit number. An example of the command would be `/pops run onboarding 00000`. If BambooHR's API is down, this ChatOps command will fail and will need to be created manually.
1. You will be pinged in Slack once the onboarding issue is created, which usually takes 30 seconds or so. The ping will include a link to the new onboarding issue.
1. Check and update if applicable the Name from Legal to Preferred name.
1. If the new team member is on the executive team, or if the new team member reports to a member of the executive team, please also assign the issue to the appropriate Executive Business Administrator(https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/eba/).
1. Update if applicable the title with the Specialty as the bot does not add the Specialty so it must be manually added.
1. If the manager is not automatically assigned and listed in the issue, add them. It could be because the employee's manager uses a name in GitLab that is very different from the one in BambooHR, and they don't use their `@gitlab.com` email ID as the primary email ID in GitLab. They will then manually need to be assigned.
1. Copy and paste the link into the People Exp/Ops Task Tracker sheet in the team member's specific column on their line. Please note that this document is only viewable to the People Experience and People Operation Specialist Teams due to personal information.
1. Once the onboarding issue has been opened, the Employment Bot will ping the manager in the issue if no Baseline Entitlement Access Request exists. In the event that a manager pings the Bot/People Experience Associate that one does exist (usually providing a link to the correct template), follow the steps below:
  1. is the role template title == the team member's role
  1. is the role template’s department folder == the team member's department
  1. is the role template specified on speciality level and == the team member's specility the same
  - Open the team members BambooHR profile and verify the above
  - If the Access Request template can be used for the specific team member, add the role to the [Shared Components file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/shared_components.yml)
  - Assign the merge request for the shared components file to IT OPs Manager to review and merge. Once merged, this will ensure that the template is created by day 2 (if merged before then)
1. If a Baseline Entitlement Access Request exists, this will be [automatically](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/onboarding/#access-request-issue-creation) opened by the Bot on day 2. 
1. If you are part of the People Experience team, IT Ops team, new team members's manager or onboarding buddy please note there are additional steps to complete directly in the new hire's onboarding issue in the 'Before Starting at GitLab' section.

### People Experience Pre-Start Onboarding Tasks

#### Request Signature for Code of Conduct 2021 & Acknowledgement of Relocation 2021

Each assigned People Experience Associate will send their new team members our Code of Conduct 2021 and Acknowledgement of Relocation 2021 forms for review and signature.

1. In BambooHR, go to the Files section.
1. Be sure you are in the Signature Templates section.
1. To the right of the `Code of Conduct 2021`, click on the triangle to the right of the gear icon and click Request Signature.

1. Click on Code of Conduct 2021.pdf or Acknowledgement of Relocation 2021.pdf and notice the team members who were sent the document and have still not signed.
1. If a team member was sent the document for signature or reminder over 2 weeks in the past, click the Bell icon on their line at the far right. Clicking on the bell will send them a notification to sign.

### People Experience Day 1 Onboarding Tasks

#### Verify Team Members Legal Name

Once you have seen the team member's legal ID (either through work eligibility confirmation or employee upload), please edit the 3 Name fields (First Name(s), Middle Name(s), Last Name(s)) to ensure that the team member's full and complete legal name is shown in BambooHR.

#### Onboarding Welcome Email

The new team member will automically recieve a "Welcome to Onboarding" email. The People Experience team will be CCd on this process. More information about this email automation can be found [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/email-automation/#onboarding-email). The team member will follow the instructions in the welcome email to access Okta and their GSuite account (this is no longer a manual process).

#### New Hire Swag Email

The "New Hire Swag" email is [automatically](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/email-automation/#swag-email) sent to the new hire on their first day with GitLab, with people-exp @gitlab.com cc'ed in the email. The email will state that the team members need to access the [GitLab Swag Store](https://shop.gitlab.com/), choose goods and use the new hire discount code provided in the email at checkout. New hires must use their GitLab email at checkout.

The People Experience Associates assigned to the respective team members onboarding is responsible for ensuring that the email is successfully sent on Day 1 and will be checked off in the onboarding issue as part of the tasks list.

#### Okta Issues

In the event that team members experience any difficulties with gaining access to their Okta account when the IT Ops team is not available, the People Experience team are able to submit a reset password option via the Okta Admin Panel as per the following steps:

- On the main Okta Admin Dashboard, search for the team members GitLab email address under `People`, select the relevant email address from the dropdown.
- In the team members profile, click on the `reset password` in the top right-hand side of the page.
- This will send a new email to the team member to recreate their Okta login.

#### Invite to Moo

We expect every team member to be an advocate for GitLab and we offer every team member the opportunity to have business cards, to make GitLab feel real to people around them despite not having an office.

Every Tuesday, the assigned People Experience Associate in the rotation, which will invite the new team members for that week, as per [this](/handbook/people-group/people-experience-team/#weekly-moo-report) process. 

Business cards should be ordered by the team member themselves using the Moo platform. Self-help instructions are [here](/handbook/people-group/frequent-requests/#business-cards).

#### Create Interview Training Issue

1. The Interview Training Issue will be created automatically one week after the team members start date. [Information about this automation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/employment-issues/#interview-training--becoming-a-manager).
2. This task is _only applicable for new team members that are people managers_.

#### Create Becoming a GitLab Manager Issue

2. This task is _only applicable for new team members that are people managers_.

## Compliance and Ownership
The People Experience Team is responsible for monitoring and facilitating the completion of the onboarding issue.

People Experience Associates will complete the following tasks.

### Timing

#### Before Start Date
2 Business Days Prior:
   - Check that manager has started their onboarding tasks.
      - If not, ping the manager in the issue.
   - Check that the Onboarding Buddy has started their tasks.
     - If not, ping the buddy or manager in the issue.

#### After Start Date
On Start Date
  - Check that the manager has completed the "Before Starting tasks".
    - If not, send a slack message to the manager.
  - Check that the buddy has completed the "Before Starting tasks".
    - If not, send a slack message to the manager.

After Day 1
  - Check that the team member has completed Day 1 Security tasks

After Day 3
  - Add the Encryption Label - Complete or Missing.
    - If missing, request the new team member complete the task as soon as possible.

After Week 1
  - Check that the new team member is progressing through the onboarding issue. Check in with the team member to ensure they are not stuck on any task.


## Total Rewards Analyst Onboarding Tasks

1. Audit the BambooHR Entry. Download a copy of the contract from the Documents Tab. Verify the information (start date, title, stock, etc) matches the entries in BambooHR as outlined in [Adding a New Team Member to BambooHR](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/#bamboohr-profile-data). Add US team members to the appropriate Benefit Group.
1. If all the information is correct, mark the new hire as complete on the "Payroll Changes Report" in BambooHR.
1. At the end of each week a Total Rewards Analyst will review all data entered into BambooHR through the Payroll Change Report for audit purposes. Once a month an audit should be conducted from all payroll providers to ensure the salary information matches BambooHR

## Onboarding Process for Rehires

In the event that a former team member is rehired with the company, they will still need to go through standard onboarding. There are different factors that need to be considered and actioned prior to the team member joining. For example, the team member will still need to complete all Security and Compliance pieces to ensure that as a company we are remaining compliant (Code of Conduct, Security training, Employment Verification).

#### Candidate Experience Specialist Team

- Ensure that the team members Greenhouse profile is linked to their original profile to ensure that a duplicate BambooHR profile is not created.
- Notify the People Experience team as soon as possible that a former team member has been rehired in the private `people-exp_ces` Slack channel.
- If the team member has not been sync with BambooHR, you may need to run a [Resync](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/gh-bhr-sync/#missing-team-member)

#### People Experience Team

- Check when the team member was offboarded previously. Open a new onboarding issue if the team member was offboarded more than 3 months ago, or open a customised onboarding issue if offboarding took place in the last 3 months.
  - If a custom onboarding issue is created, be sure to include the default onboarding template table as the employment automation relies on the information.
- Dependent upon the team members location, an employment verification may need to be commpleted (example: US team member needs to complete I-9 verification).
  - If an I9 is needed you will need to run a rehire sync with [LawLogix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/onboarding/#rehired-team-member) if a previous I9 is present. If an I9 is not available then a new I9 will need to be created.
- Verify that the team members former email address is still available by searching in Google Workspace. Keep this email address the same as far as possible.
- Reactivate the team members previous BambooHR profile to avoid duplicates from being created, as well as update any new employment terms.
    - Status on Personal tab: set to Active.
    - Employment Status: add new entry with new start date and set to Active.
    - Update Job Information with start date and role as per details in Greenhouse / contract.
    - Verify that a Hire Date and Original Hire Date exists on the Job tab.
    - Download a copy of the new signed contract from Greenhouse and upload to Documents section in BambooHR.
    - Enable Employee Self-Service.
- Ping IT Ops once the onboarding issue has been created to ensure that no issues are experienced on the team members first day back with any previous systems.
- Notify Payroll and Total Rewards team in the onboarding issue on the team members first day in order to be added back to payroll and relevant systems. This should be done at the latest on day 3.

## Onboarding Process for Interns

Internships are utilized when we are sponsoring a specific program for students to earn credit to their school/university. Although the interns will not be official team members, onboarding is still required for security and compliance reasons. Once an intern is marked as hired in Greenhouse, the [automation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/gh-bhr-sync/) in place will sync the intern to BambooHR and the People Experience team will be notified via Slack alerts channel.

#### Creating the Onboarding Issue

We would follow the same onboarding issue creation [process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/employment-issues/#creation) when creating the issue for the Interns. The template has been edited to allow for additional tasks to be added for the interns.

#### I-9 Process

The standard I-9 [process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-processes/#procedure) will be implemented between BambooHR and LawLogix for **paid** interns.

- If an intern is in the US on a student visa, additional documentation is [required](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents/additional-documentation-requirements).
   - Passport
   - I94
   - I20 - this must be completed during the hiring process
     - In Section 2 of Form I-9, the designated agent should enter the foreign passport information in the first area and the I-94 information in the second area in the List A column. Enter the information from the Form I-20, which includes the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) number and expiration date (i.e., the Form I-20 CPT employment authorization end date (Must match section 1 date), not the program end date) in the third area in the List A column.
   - In Section 2 of Form I-9, the designated agent should enter the foreign passport information in the first area and the I-94 information in the second area in the List A column. Enter the information from the Form I-20, which includes the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) number and expiration date (i.e., the Form I-20 CPT employment authorization end date (Must match section 1 date), not the program end date) in the third area in the List A column.
   - **Unpaid interns are not required to complete an I-9.**
- If an intern is hired on for a full time position and there is a break in employment a re-verification (Section 3) will need to be completed.
- Once the internship has been completed, terminate the intern in the LawLogix system.
- **If an intern is hired on for a full time position and there is a break in employment a re-verification (Section 3) will need to be completed.**

#### BambooHR Profile

The BambooHR Profile will follow all of the same rules as a normal onboarding with these exceptions:

- Part-Time
- Compensation Table: Overtime - `Non-Exempt`
- Currency Conversion: `Blank`
- Employment Status: Only add `Active Date`
- Interns do not have a probation period - ensure to delete any country specific probation period information from BambooHR

## Offboarding Interns

If the intern is not offered full time employment with GitLab, the same [offboarding process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/employment-issues/#creation-1) will need to take place to ensure that access is deactivated and the intern is removed from all systems.

**Talent Acquisition or the CES team will notify the People Experience team via Slack when an intern is not offered full time employment with GitLab so that the offboarding can be scheduled at the date of the end of the intership agreement.**

## Onboarding Process for Interns converting to Hired Team Members

In some instances, the interns that have been onboarded may be hired on a full time basis after successfully completing their internship with GitLab. This lists the steps required from all the different stakeholders:

#### People Business Partner / Managers

- Check in on feedback with all hosting teams
- Performing performance/skills assessments with interns based on the Job Families and Competencies
- Sharing feedback with interns
- Aligning with Finance/Business on headcount/budget
- Making a decision on offers to interns
- If team member will be hired, notify Talent Acquisition team
- Communicating the offer/no offer to interns
- Awaiting final decision of interns
- Notify all stakeholders involved via email (including People Experience Team)
- End of the internship program
- New start date for intern as full time team member

#### Recruitment

- Discuss any changes with the People Business Partner / Manager.
- Notify the Candidate Experience Specialist team to create and send contracts to the interns.

#### Candidate Experience Specialist

- Assist with creating the respective contracts for the interns that are offered full time employment with GitLab.
- Reconfirm with the People Experience team that the intern is transitioning to full time team member in the private Slack channel.

#### Total Rewards

As the interns already have entries in BambooHR, an update will be needed with the new employment terms.

- Update role to Individual Contributor.
- Employment status update from termination status to active.
- Locality is important to decide salary - need to be mindful of where the intern is located and where their final destination will be.
- Need to check on benefits when converted.
- Check that all employee statuses are correct (employment, pay, hire vs start date).

#### Payroll

- Check that the team member's info has been received from a payroll perspective.
- Verify employment details.
- Enroll the team member into any benefits for their location.

#### People Experience

- Create the customised Career Mobility issue 4 days prior to the start date.
- Assist with creating an offboarding issue (if applicable when there is a break between internship and hire date) and having accounts deactivated.
- Ensure all information in BambooHR is correct.
  - Hire Date = Start Date of job (If there is a break in employment)
  - Orginal Hire Date = Start of Internship
- Initiate the relevant payroll documents (I9, UK, Netherlands, etc).

## Onboarding Core Team Members

Core team members are team member that are not employed by GitLab but are part of the wider GitLab community. These team members can be granted access to certain systems at request from the Community Relations team by creating the respective [Core Team Member Onboarding Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/temporary-service-providers/lifecycle/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/orientation_issue_core_member.md).

The Community Relations teamwill ping the People Experience team in the `#people-connect` Slack channel for assistance.

There are tasks within the issue that need to be completed by the People Experience Team.
