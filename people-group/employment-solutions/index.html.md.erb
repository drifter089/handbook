## Team Member Types by Country

GitLab has a few different team member types. The following tables each show how we hire and scale around the world, where we have entities, where we use Professional Employer Organisations, and how we add new countries to our list.

To ensure the accurate entry of information in BambooHR, we created this table as guidance of what is applicable in which location. When adding new team members to BambooHR, please ensure you use this terminology for accurate reporting.

More information related to payroll processes can be found on the [Payroll handbook page](/handbook/finance/payroll/).

### GitLab Entities

| Country | Team Member Type(s) | Entity | Pay Frequency | Paid By | BambooHR Profile (Y/N) |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------- | ---------------------- |

### PEO (Professional Employer Organization/ Employer of Record and not a GitLab entity)

There are multiple options for PEO (Professional Employer Organizations), also known as Employers of Record, in the market. This is not the exact list of providers GitLab uses, but is intended to help the wider community when looking for vendors:

- Safeguard (Mostly used as the Employer of Record for permanent employment.)
- CXC (Mostly used in locations where it is socially acceptable to be a Company to Company Contractor. Workers can usually choose to be contracted through their own limited company, or as a individual contractor, however in Russia we can only support Company to Company Contractors.)
- Global Upside (Mostly used as the Employer of Record for permanent employment.)
- Remote.com (Mostly used as the Employer of Record for permanent employment.)

This table reflects where we use PEO's currently:

| Country | Agreement Type(s) | Hiring Partner | Entity to Invoice (for AP only) | Pay Frequency | Paid By | BambooHR Profile (Y/N) | Scalable PEO (Y/N) | Open for hiring (Y/N) |

Contact information for our PEO representatives is found in the `Entity & Co-Employer HR Contacts` note in the PeopleOps vault in 1Password. If a team member, manager or PBP has a question relating to a PEO, their process, or any related procedure for a PEO-employed team member, please reach out to the Employment Solutions Specialist (@rhendrick) who will liaise and find a solution with the PEO's support.

### Team members hired as Contractors via our GitLab IT BV Entity

Where we do not have an entity or a PEO, we hire team members via our GitLab IT BV entity as independent or C2C contractors. 

# International Expansion

## Country hiring guidelines

At GitLab, we hire people from all over the world and all walks of life. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is one of our [core values](/handbook/values/). However, as an [all-remote company](/company/culture/all-remote/) we do face challenges with hiring in certain countries. Each country has unique and complex rules, laws, and regulations, that can affect our ability to conduct business, as well as the employability of the citizens and residents of those countries.

We are growing and continuously expanding our hiring capabilities in a variety of geographies. However, at this time we are unable to hire employees and contractors in certain specified countries due to a variety of reasons. Specific country hiring information is discussed with potential candidates. GitLab is able to hire team members who are eligible to work in the location of their residence. GitLab cannot assist or facilitate a process to help you become eligible to work in a location if you do not already have that eligibility. The hiring in certain countries can be paused for a variety of reasons at any time. In other locations, hiring is not possible. Countries where hiring is either not possible or currently paused are:

<% no_hiring_countries.each do |country| %>
  - <%= country %>
<% end %>

## Country Conversions

As GitLab continues to scale, we will be converting all team members to an employment scalable solution as per our [OKR](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/fy20-q3/). Team members are hired in the following ways:

- Contractor through a PEO (Professional Employer Organization with a local presence)
- Employees through a PEO (Professional Employer Organization)
- GitLab entity

To better understand how we decide on what country to convert next, please follow this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17e7ou1bRQn0PvpgnEUs3Yqgk6LNWTpxwCJvHuDeBbAg/edit?ts=5efb740e#gid=0) to our risk matrix (this is an internal document, as this is unique to GitLab). We measure risk on both the total target cash & the number of team members in said location. To follow along on the progress, view our [Country Conversions and Entity tracking issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/issues/367)(this link is internal to GitLab team members only).

This also aligns with GitLab's [strategy](/company/strategy/#sequence) and growth plans.

We were interviewed live by members of the Recruiting and People Business Partner teams, and we encourage all team members to watch this video with frequently asked questions about Country Conversions:

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Eoo4QJXr4E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

The Employment Solutions Specialist is responsible for managing the country conversion processes outlined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/country_conversions.md).

## Compensation Review for Country Conversions

As part of the country conversion and benefits review process, the Total Rewards and Employment Solutions Specialist will review the gross value of cash compensation and benefits while also ensuring alignment to the employee rate in the compensation calculator.

The total rewards and people ops specialist team should also review alignment to the compensation ranges based on the new employee status and the range of the compensation calculator. Whenever we change salaries as part of a country conversion, these should be consistently applied among all team members in that country.

## Relocation / Address Change

This process is managed by the People Operations Specialist team as the DRI, in partnership with Total Rewards and the People Business Partners. For any questions not addressed below, please email peopleops@gitlab.com.

If you are considering a move it is best to discuss this with your manager as soon as possible, always before you are thinking of moving, to understand the impact to compensation or your role at GitLab. First, the company retains discretion at all times whether to allow you to continue your role in the new location.  In some instances a move will not align to your proposed location, (e.g. a recruiter hired in EMEA to support EMEA would not be approved to move to the US), and in other instances the company may not be able to support a hire in the proposed location. Second, in almost all situations the compensation may change. For an idea about the compensation impact, please check with our Total Rewards team for an estimate.  The actual compensation amount will be reviewed and will need approval before relocation can occur.

### Short-Term Stay

If you are not changing your permanent location (where you maintain permanent residency), but instead are traveling to different locations over a period of time, you are responsible for maintaining your health insurance, visas, and any other item directly relating to your travel.

Since any short-term stay is your decision and not required by GitLab as part of your role, you will not be eligible to use the Business Accident Travel Policy or submit any expenses related to your travel. If you are hired in a role requiring a time zone alignment, you must still be able to fulfill that requirement.

If your short-term stay is for less than 6 months in a new location, there should be no need to update your address in BambooHR. If you plan on staying in a location for more than 6 months, or are in that location for an aggregate of more than 6 months in a single calendar year, that becomes your residence and you must complete the long-term relocation process described below. In most countries, tax residency is determined by the place where a GitLab Team Member keeps its vital interests. This is the place where you are registered, where your SO and/or dependents live, the place where you work, where you live, where you keep your subscriptions etc.

** Please note that in some jurisdictions, even short term stays can add up to more than 183 days per year and can subject you to payroll tax in the new location.  Anything that does not look like a temporary stay can be reviewed as staying somewhere to establish a residence for tax purposes. GitLab cannot provide you individual tax advice but you should always make sure to check with your tax advisor before traveling to any location where you will be performing work for an extended period of time, whether it is more than or less than 183 days. 

### Long-Term Relocation

#### Eligibility to Work

If you are interested in a possible long-term relocation (defined below), you need to confirm that you would be eligible to work in that location.  Except for the Netherlands, GitLab does not provide any form of sponsorship or immigration aid for team members who choose to move to new countries.   For more information, please refer to our Visa page. GitLab cannot assist or facilitate a process to help you become eligible to work in a location if you do not already have that eligibility. You are of course free to apply and gain that eligibility if there are steps you can take that do not involve GitLab.  Once you are certain that you are eligible to work in your requested Relocation country, you will need to provide proof of eligibility by uploading the proof in the Documents tab of your BambooHR profile. If you move before establishing eligibility to work, but then cannot establish eligibility to work in the new location within the first six months of residency, it may affect your ability to continue your role with GitLab.

#### Long-Term Relocation Definition

A long-term relocation means that you will establish yourself in a new location outside of your current residential area. If you are ending your current residential living arrangement, spending more than six months in one calendar year in one location as part of an extensive period of travel and/or will have your mail delivered to an address in a different city, please follow the steps below.

It is at the company's discretion to determine whether it can approve the relocation:
  - Some job positions require GitLab team members to be located in particular countries, locations, regions, or time zones.  For example, a salesperson hired to serve a specific region may need to stay in that region.
  - GitLab may not have a scalable employment solution available in the country to which you intend to relocate.  Please confirm with peopleops@gitlab.com whether GitLab hires in the country in question.
  - As noted above, you can only work in countries where you can establish eligibility to work in the country.
  - Relocation may also result in an adjustment to compensation based on the location and the location factor.  The Company retains discretion to determine whether it can support such an adjustment.  

Assuming that relocation is approved, the location factor of the new location may result in an adjustment to compensation.  Depending on the location factor and the benefits offered in the particular country, this adjustment may result in an increase or a decrease to compensation.
At the onset, this practice sounds harsh when moving to a lower-paid location. One might argue that it seems unfair for the organization to pay someone less for the same work in the same role, regardless of where they go. However, if you look at it from another angle for a minute and compare this practice to what most companies do, it should make more sense. For example, say you work for a company with physical locations and say they haven't accepted that remote work is as productive as coming into the office yet. If you wanted to pack up and move to a location where they did not have a physical site, you would have no alternative but to resign and seek new employment in your new location. You would find quickly that companies in the area pay at a locally competitive rate.

Now, let's say the company did have a site in your new location and they offered the flexibility to transfer. If they did not have a similar position open, you would have to either apply for a different open position in the same company or resign and apply externally (back to the realization that other companies will pay at local competitive rate). If you were lucky enough that they did have a similar role in the new location, a transfer would come with a pay rate based on the local market to ensure equity across all incumbents (people in the job) by location.

Adjusting pay according to the local market in all cases is fair to everyone. We can't remain consistent if we make exceptions to the policy and allow someone to make greater than local competitive rate for the same work others in that region are doing (or will be hired to do). We realize we might lose a few good people over this policy, but being fair to all team members is not negotiable. It is a value we stand behind and take very seriously.

#### How To Apply for a Long-Term Relocation

##### Approval
**Team Member**
_If you are moving to a different country, please start this process no later than 3 months before your ideal relocation date.  If your relocation is within the same country, please start the process no later than 30 days before your ideal relocation date._

1. Per the Eligibility to Work section above, confirm that you have uploaded proof of your eligibility to work in your requested relocation country.
1. Submit an email to the People Operations Specialist at peopleops@gitlab.com.  Explain your eligibility to work in the new location, as well as your timing and plans, in this email.  
Assuming your relocation is approved, any applicable changes in compensation will not be effective until the date you start working in the new location.


**Note: Assuming your relocation is approved, any applicable changes in compensation will not be effective until your move date (or the date you start working in the new location), which will be listed as the effective date on your new contract.**

**People Ops, Total Rewards, PBP's & Payroll**

**Please check the Country Conversion and Entity Creation Tracking issue to be aware of upcoming country conversions and to confirm where the Company currently hires.  These are the only countries where team members can relocate.  For certain limited situations, the Company may be able to consider a scalable employment solution in new countries.  You may open an issue and assign to employment solutions.**

1. People Ops will confirm eligibility, documentation, timing and any other information as applicable. If the team member is not eligible to relocate, the People Operations Specialist team will communicate this fact to the team member at this time.
1. The People Operations Specialist can escalate to the Senior Manager, People Operations, Director of Tax, and Director of Legal, Employment for further review..
1. If the relocation is within the exact same geographical location and country as linked to the team member’s current location factor, no approval is needed.  Direct the team member to update their address in the Personal tab in their BambooHR profile.  The People Operations Specialist will confirm that the address has been updated in BambooHR and that there are no other steps necessary to complete the relocation.  The People Operations Specialist will confirm that the address has been updated in BambooHR and confirm to all team members involved that the relocation process is complete and that there are no other steps.
1. If the team member is eligible to work in the country to which they are requesting relocation and GitLab hires in that country, the People Operations Specialist will request written approval from the team member's manager and relevant People Business Partner. The People Business Partner should connect with the manager to confirm there are no existing performance concerns. If there are, follow up discussion may be needed.
1. If the relocation request relates to a _higher location factor_, forward both approvals to the team member's Division's E-Group leader for their written approval. Where applicable, copy in the Director and VP of the Division in the email to the E-Group Leader, as they are closer to the process. This is to create visibility for them and an opportunity for them to halt the relocation if need be.
1. If the relocation request relates to a _lower location factor_ or _equivalent location factor (even if it is in the same country)_, continue to the next step.
1. If the relocation is declined at any step, the People Operations Specialist will relay this first to the People Business Partner, who will work with People Operations, Total Rewards, and the team member’s manager to develop a basis for the declination to explain to the team member.
1. The People Operations Specialist will forward all approvals to the Total Rewards team at total-rewards@ gitlab.com so that they may review and approve any compensation change, with feedback from the manager and the People Business Partner.
1. Total Rewards will communicate final compensation information by email to the People Operations Specialist team in the email thread.
1. The People Operations Specialist will convert the approved compensation from USD to the local pay currency of the team member's new location, use the [rounding best practice](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#rounding-best-practice) method, and then request approval from Total Rewards of this final compensation amount.
_Ex. Team member is approved $50,000 USD as their new comp and they are relocating to the Netherlands. Team members in the Netherlands are paid in Euro. Using the Jan 1, 2020 conversion, this converts to 44,577.20 Euro. Using the rounding best practice, the team member's comp will be 44,600 Euro, with Total Rewards approval._
1. The People Operations Specialist will convey to the team member that their relocation has been approved and relay their new compensation, if applicable. cc the relevant Payroll team (`uspayroll @gitlab.com` or `nonuspayroll @gitlab.com`) for visibility on any upcoming changes.
1. The People Operations Specialist will ensure that all approval documents including email threads are saved in the team member's BambooHR `Contracts & Changes` folder.
1. The People Operations Specialist will reach out to the People Experience team to prepare a [Letter of Adjustment](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#letter-of-adjustment) or new contract when applicable.

##### Relocation within the Same Country

**People Experience Associate**

1. Create a [Letter of Adjustment](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#letter-of-adjustment), per the stated process in the Promotions & Transfers handbook page.

- A letter is only needed if there is a compensation change. If there is no change in compensation, then the People Operations Specialist should direct the team member to update their address in the Personal tab in their BambooHR profile.

1. Once the letter of adjustment has been created, ping the People Experience Associate or People Specialist team for auditing.
1. Stage the letter in HelloSign and send for signature first to the Senior Manager, Total Rewards and subsequently to the team member.
1. Upload the signed document to the team member's `Contracts & Changes` folder in BambooHR.
1. Make any necessary updates to the team member's BambooHR profile and email Total Rewards `total-rewards@ gitlab.com` and Payroll `uspayroll@ gitlab.com` or `nonuspayroll@ gitlab.com` to notify them of the changes.

**Team Member**

1. Update your address in the Personal tab in your BambooHR profile. Your address will then turn grey until it has been approved by the Total Rewards team.

**Total Rewards**

1. For US team members - update the locality in BambooHR and update the benefit group if required.
1. If the team member is moving from one entity to another (certain countries have more than one entity), list them as terminated on the appropriate payroll changes file for the current entity and add them as a new hire in the appropriate payroll changes file for the new entity.
1. Check that any necessary changes to payroll and benefits administration are processed in time.

##### Relocation to a New Country

###### Relocating to the Netherlands 

The steps our People Operations Specialist team uses to support relocation to the Netherlands:
1. Once approval has been gained based during the [Relocation process](/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/#how-to-apply-for-a-long-term-relocation) and the requirements to relocate to the Netherlands have been met, a member of the People Operations Specialist team will add the approval to BambooHR under "Contracts & Changes".  
1. Next, the People Operations Specialist will reach out to our Payroll vendor in the Netherlands and cc the team member in the email to the vendor.
1. The vendor will then supply all the documentation needed to apply for relocation including information about: [30% Ruling Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ok6LS9T4P6tnPu2N6BDRDeveOYzd1ILpkbQRhl911w4/edit?ts=5caf1bca), [wage tax](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8N-idoYGFSCw2ajat9RscfQ004EL-PS/view) form and potentially an application for a BSN Number.
- **During COVID a letter stating your requirement to relocate to the Netherlands at such time is required, the People ops specialist will provide the vendor with such, using the following [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yE7DrHBLOj0blBJwaOIC8f2bLMFS10wYUZvg9BqjnF4/edit?ts=5e592e30)** 
- **A completed health declaration form, the vendor will provide this to you**.
1. Details on that process can be found under the BSN number section on the [visas page](/handbook/people-group/visas/#bsn-number) in the handbook.
1. The People Operations Specialist team will need to review if the position is in development or research, it likely qualifies for [WBSO (R&D tax credit)](/handbook/people-group/#wbso-rd-tax-credit-in-the-netherlands); add to the WBSO hour tracker and inform our WBSO consultant. If you have any questions, feel free to ping our People Business Partner that is currently located in the Netherlands or our Director of Tax, also located in the Netherlands that can help evaluate eligibility.
1. Once the approved Visa and 30% ruling is received by the team member, the team members should email this to PeopleOps for filing in BambooHR.
1. The People Operations team should also notify the Total Rewards and Payroll team regarding the completion of the relocation.

Important:  If the team member has been with GitLab for two or more years at the time they are asking to relocate to the Netherlands, the team member should be issued an indefinite contract. 

**People Experience Team**

1. Create a new contract for the team member confirming new compensation (if applicable) and effective date.
1. Once the contract has been created, ping the People Experience Associate or Manager, People Operations for auditing.
1. Stage the contract in HelloSign and send for signature first to the Senior Director, People Success and subsequently to the team member.
1. Upload the signed document to the team member's `Contracts & Changes` folder in BambooHR.
  -If the team member is relocating to the Netherlands, please see above. 
1. If applicable, create a Mutual Termination Agreement. Stage in HelloSign and send for signature first to the Senior Director, People Success and subsequently to the team member. Upload the signed document to the team member's `Contracts & Changes` folder in BambooHR.
1. Make any necessary updates to the team member's BambooHR profile and email Total Rewards `total-rewards@ gitlab.com` and Payroll `uspayroll@ gitlab.com` or `nonuspayroll@ gitlab.com` to notify them of the changes.
1. People Operations Specialist - Update the hiring manager and PBP in the original email thread that all tasks assigned to the DRI: People Operations Specialist relating to the relocation process are complete, for clarity. Other teams, such as Total Rewards and Payroll may still be updating their systems.

**Team Member**

1. Update your address in the Personal tab in your BambooHR profile. Your address will then turn grey until it has been approved by the Total Rewards team.

**Total Rewards**
