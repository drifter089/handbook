## Team Member Types by Country

GitLab has a few different team member types. The following tables each show how we hire and scale around the world, where we have entities, where we use Professional Employer Organisations, and how we add new countries to our list.

To ensure the accurate entry of information in BambooHR, we created this table as guidance of what is applicable in which location. When adding new team members to BambooHR, please ensure you use this terminology for accurate reporting.

More information related to payroll processes can be found on the [Payroll handbook page](/handbook/finance/payroll/).

### Team Members Hired as Contractors via our GitLab IT BV Entity

Where we do not have an entity or a PEO, team members contract with our GitLab IT BV entity as independent or C2C contractors. 

# International Expansion

## Country Hiring Guidelines

At GitLab, we hire people from all over the world and all walks of life. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is one of our [core values](/handbook/values/). However, as an [all-remote company](/company/culture/all-remote/) we do face challenges with hiring in certain countries. Each country has unique and complex rules, laws, and regulations, that can affect our ability to conduct business, as well as the employability of the citizens and residents of those countries.

We are growing and continuously expanding our hiring capabilities in a variety of geographies. However, at this time we are unable to hire team members in certain specified countries due to a variety of reasons. Specific country hiring information is discussed with potential candidates. GitLab is able to hire team members who are eligible to work in the location of their residence. GitLab cannot assist or facilitate a process to help you become eligible to work in a location if you do not already have that eligibility. The hiring in certain countries can be paused for a variety of reasons at any time. In other locations, hiring is not possible. Countries where hiring is either not possible or currently paused are:

<% no_hiring_countries.each do |country| %>
  - <%= country %>
<% end %>

## Country Conversions

As GitLab continues to scale, we will be converting all team members to an employment scalable solution.  Team members are hired in the following ways:

- Contractor through a PEO (Professional Employer Organization with a local presence)
- Employees through a PEO (Professional Employer Organization)
- GitLab entity

The Employment Solutions Partner is responsible for managing the country conversion processes outlined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/country_conversions.md).

## Compensation Review for Country Conversions

As part of the country conversion and benefits review process, the Total Rewards and Employment Solutions Partner will review the gross value of cash compensation and benefits while also ensuring alignment to the employee rate in the compensation calculator.

The total rewards and people ops specialist team should also review alignment to the compensation ranges based on the new employee status and the range of the compensation calculator. Whenever we change salaries as part of a country conversion, these should be consistently applied among all team members in that country.
