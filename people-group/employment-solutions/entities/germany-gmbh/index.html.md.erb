## Pay slip provider

[Cloudpay](https://self-service.cloudpay.net/) is the current pay slip provider. It is recommended to regularly download the pay slip pdf documents (German / English) and store them in a safe place. The provider also allows to access important tax documents:

- Meldebescheinigung zur Sozialversicherung (this is an important document to keep because in this is proof that you paid into the pension funds).
- Ausdruck der elektronischen Lohnsteuerbescheinigung (yearly tax certificate)

## Post
