### OOO Handover Process for People Experience Team

1. The People Experience Associate will open a PEA Handover OOO [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/PEA_OOO_Handover_Issue.md) and tag all Associates in the issue at least the day before their scheduled OOO. If there are confidential items/tasks that need to be handed over, please create a Google doc, share with the team and link to the issue.
1. Get assistance from the People Operation Specialist team if additional hands are needed.


## People Experience Team Processes

All queries will be attempted to be resolved within the specific time zones and relevant SLA's. If unforeseen circumstances prevents the People Experience Associates from completing a specific/urgent task, a message will be posted in the `#pea-team` Slack channel to handover any important tasks / messages to the next team member available. 

### Bi-Weekly Rotations 

On a bi-weekly occurence, the People Experience Team will open a [PEA Rotation Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Weekly-Rotation-PEA.md). This rotation issue reflects what tasks the PEA's are accountable for and to be completed within the 2 weeks which lists how the tasks are shared amongst the team.  

Certain tasks will be allocated based on a ongoing rotation between all People Experience Associates. 

The following factors will also be taken into consideration:

- Scheduled PTO for the team members
- Ensure that the tasks split evenly and fairly 
- A tracker will be kept to track the data of how the tasks are split up

**The following tasks will be completed by any available People Experience Associate within the designated SLA:**

- Verification Of Employment 
- Anniversary Queries

#### Allocations for Onboarding

- We always try and split evenly and fairly.
- Not time zone specific to ensure that all Associates learn all aspects to different countries during onboarding. 

#### Allocations for Offboarding

- Team has 12 hours to create and notify of the offboarding issue.
- Due to different time zones, the offboarding issue creation and task completion can be tagged team by the Associates. 

#### Allocations for Career Mobility 

- We always try and split evenly and fairly. 

### Audits and Quarterly Rotations

#### Referral Bonus Audit

Weekly on a Friday, the People Experience team will be pinged in the `#peopleops-alerts` Slack channel to complete an audit of whether referral bonuses have been added to the referring team members profile in BambooHR (for referring new hires for the last 3 months). This is part of an [existing automation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engineering/slack-integrations/#referral-bonus-reminders). 

The People Experience Associate will open the Greenhouse entry to confirm whether a referral was made for the new team member. If yes, proceed to the BambooHR profile of the referring team member and verify that a bonus has been added correctly as per the [referral requirements](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/incentives/#referral-bonuses).

### Monthly Reporting

#### Retaining & Purging Form I-9

Per the [USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Service](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/retention-and-storage), form I-9, which is completed for all US-based team members, must be retained and purged according to the USCIS retention policies.

**Form I-9 must be retained as long as a team member is Active. If a US-based team member is Inactive, Form I-9 must be purged 3 years after a team member's start date _or_ 1 year after their departure date, whichever is later.**

Example 1: Team member Marie Curie's start date was 2017-01-01 and she departed the company on 2021-06-01. Her Form I-9 must be purged after 2022-06-01.

Example 2: Team member Matt Gandhi's start date was 2019-06-01 but he departed on 2019-12-15. His Form I-9 must be purged after 2022-06-01.

1. The People Experience team must run a monthly report in BambooHR to show all Inactive US-based team members and compare it to Guardian's Inactive team member report. 
1. The People Experience team confirm the correct purging dates in the Guarding report using the above formula to calculate how long Form I-9 must be kept for the relevant team members and then purge them after the calculated time period. 
1. When a team member has passed a purging date, the People Experience team must:

    - Confirm with Guardian that the team member I-9 records have been deleted.
    - Review the team member's Verification folder in BambooHR to ensure that no form I-9 copies are present. Delete form I-9 if found. Receipt and confirmation of work eligibility do not need to be deleted.

### Letters of Employment and Employee Verification Requests

This lists the steps for the People Experience team to follow when receiving requests:

#### Letters of Employment 

Team Members are able to request a Letter of Employment using the [documented form](/handbook/people-group/frequent-requests/#letter-of-employment) for this purpose.  Once submitted they will receive an auto-populated document utilising the data housed in BambooHR i.e. compensation; length of tenure; nature of employment (full or part-time) etc. along with an indication that GitLab is an all remote company.

#### Employee Verifications

We may be contacted by different vendors who require a team members employment to be verified along with other personal information. 

Most importantly, check to see whether authorisation has been received from the team member that we may provide the personal information. If no authorisation form is attached, make contact with the team member via email or Slack to get the required consent. 
- If the vendor is asking for general information in the email, simply respond back to the email with the requested information. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed, complete the form via Docusign and encrypt the document before sending via email. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed for a US team member, forward this request on to the US Payroll team to have completed. 
- If you need additional figures that we do not have access to, send a message in the `payroll-peopleops` Slack channel to request the information needed to complete the form. 

In some instances, we may be contacted by certain Governmental institutions asking for clarity into termination / seperation reasons and agreements of a team member. Please forward these emails to the relevant People Business Partner that submitted the offboarding notification, as they will have full context into the reasons and agreements and will choose to respond if needed. 

#### Probation Period Rotation

The People Experience Associate in the `Probation Period` rotation, will complete the full process as per the steps listed in the [Probation Period](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#probation-period) section of the hanbook. If the weekly rotation has come to an end and not all confirmations have been received, the Associate in the next weeks rotation will follow up with team members managers.

#### Triage People Group Issues

The People Experience Associate in the 'triage' rotation will pull up all issues opened in the [General project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/issues) and tag / assign team members according to the request. It is important that once you have triaged the issue, to update the label from `workflow:triage` to `workflow:todo / doing`. 

#### Deleting Team Member Data from Letter of Employment Rotation

Once a week, the People Experience Associate in the `deleting team member data` rotation will delete team members data submitted on the Letter of Employment response spreadsheet for the previous week.

### OSAT Team Member Feedback

Once a new team member has completed their onboarding, they are asked to complete the `Onboarding Survey` to share their experience. Based on the scores received, the People Experience Associate assigned to the specific team members onboarding, will complete the following:

- Score of 4 or higher: use own discretion based on the feedback received and see whether there are any improvements or changes that can be made to the onboarding template / onboarding process (this can be subjective). 
- Score of 3 or lower: reach out to the team member and schedule a feedback session to further discuss their concerns and feedback provided. 

### Onboarding Buddy Feedback

In the same survey, new team members are able to provide a score and feedback on their onboarding buddy. If the score and feedback received is constructive and valuable insights when the score is low, the People Experience Associate assigned to that specific team members onboarding, should reach out to the manager of the onboarding buddy and provide feedback in a polite and supportive way.  

### Onboarding Cohort Creation

During the last week of the month, the PEA in the assigned rotation will create a new slack public channel for the next month by following the below steps:

1. Afterwards, adding the information into the payroll spreadsheet, be sure to edit the bonus line in BambooHR and add `Paid` to the beginning of it. 
1. Reply all in the email with "This has been processed." This step is to make the team aware that action has been taken on the `Table Reminder: Referral Bonus` email

#### Discretionary Bonuses 

1. Discretionary bonuses go through approvals via the Nominator bot. The Experience team will be notified of bonuses that need to be approved in the private slack channel `people-group-nominator-bot`
1. The PEA should review the nomination based off the criteria [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/incentives/#valid-and-invalid-criteria-for-discretionary-bonuses) and make sure it's an appropriate bonus to approve - if there are any questions, make sure to ask for any clarification in the thread.
   - If for any reason, the bonus does not meet the criteria - reject the bonus in the slack channel and communicate to the nominator about why.
1. If the bonus meets the criteria, the PEA will approve the bonus in the slack channel and this feeds into BambooHR. You'll want to double check to make sure everything fed over correctly. 
1. After confirming everything fed over from the bot to BamboohR, the PEA will add the bonus information to the appropriate payroll changes spreadsheet (US, Non-US, or Canada)
1. Lastly, add a checkmark or any other emoji onto the Approval in the bot to signal that you have in fact completed this nomination and it's been processed.

_Note: If you received the same nomination twice (for the same person and the same reason), you may reject one. When you do this, please reach out to the team member who submitted the nomination to explain, and include the other nominator's name in the #team-member-updates announcement See more details in section for [multiple discretionary bonuses](/handbook/incentives/#multiple-discretionary-bonuses)._

#### Working Group Bonuses

1. [Working Group bonuses](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/incentives/#working-group-bonus) are done through BambooHR and not the bot. The Experience team will receive an email from BambooHR saying there is a bonus that needs approval
1. The PEA will review and approve or deny the bonus in BambooHR 
1. Next, the PEA will add the bonus information to the appropriate payroll changes spreadsheet (US, Non-US, or Canada)

#### Acting Manager Bonuses

1. TBD
