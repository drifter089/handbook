### OOO Handover Process for People Experience Team

1. The People Experience Associate will open a PEA Handover OOO [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/PEA_OOO_Handover_Issue.md) and tag all Associates in the issue at least the day before their scheduled OOO. If there are confidential items/tasks that need to be handed over, please create a Google doc, share with the team and link to the issue.
2. The People Experience Coordinator will then reassign tasks to an alternative People Experience Associate (where applicable).
3. Get assistance from the People Operation Specialist team if additional hands are needed.


## People Experience Team Processes

All queries will be attempted to be resolved within the specific time zones and relevant SLA's. If unforeseen circumstances prevents the People Experience Associates from completing a specific/urgent task, a message will be posted in the `#pea-team` Slack channel to handover any important tasks / messages to the next team member available. 

### Bi-Weekly Rotations 

On a bi-weekly occurence, the People Experience Team will open a [PEA Rotation Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Weekly-Rotation-PEA.md). This rotation issue reflects what tasks the PEA's are accountable for and to be completed within the 2 weeks which lists how the tasks are shared amongst the team. The allocation tracker can be found in the [People Exp/Ops Tracker]. 

Certain tasks will be allocated based on a ongoing rotation between all People Experience Associates. 

The following factors will also be taken into consideration:

- Scheduled PTO for the team members
- Ensure that the tasks split evenly and fairly 
- A tracker will be kept to track the data of how the tasks are split up

**The Rotation groups are listed as follows:**

- Probation Periods / Gift Requests / Anniversary Period / Triage People Ops Issues / Deleting LOE team member data / Printfection Report

- BHR Onboarding Report / Moo Report / Allocations for Onboarding, Offboarding, Mobility / TaNEWki call scheduling / Pull Social Call Metrics

- I-9 Administration / Pruning of Stale Records (TBD)

**The following tasks will be completed by any available People Experience Associate within the designated SLA:**

- Letters of Employment / VOE 
- Anniversary Queries

#### Allocations for Onboarding

- We always try and split evenly and fairly.
- Not time zone specific to ensure that all Associates learn all aspects to different countries during onboarding. 

#### Allocations for Offboarding

- Team has 12 hours to create and notify of the offboarding issue.
- The person that is in the allocation rotation will also add the offboarding to the PEA team calendar.
- Due to different time zones, the offboarding issue creation and task completion can be tagged team by the Associates. 

#### Allocations for Career Mobility 

- We always try and split evenly and fairly. 

### Audits and Quarterly Rotations

Team Members are able to request a Letter of Employment using the [documented form](/handbook/people-group/frequent-requests/#letter-of-employment) for this purpose.  Once submitted they will receive an auto-populated document utilising the data housed in BambooHR i.e. compensation; length of tenure; nature of employment (full or part-time) etc. along with an indication that GitLab is an all remote company.

#### Employee Verifications

We may be contacted by different vendors who require a team members employment to be verified along with other personal information. 

Most importantly, check to see whether authorisation has been received from the team member that we may provide the personal information. If no authorisation form is attached, make contact with the team member via email or Slack to get the required consent. 
- If the vendor is asking for general information in the email, simply respond back to the email with the requested information. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed, complete the form via HelloSign and encrypt the document before sending via email. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed for a US team member, forward this request on to the US Payroll team to have completed. 
- If you need additional figures that we do not have access to, send a message in the `payroll-peopleops` Slack channel to request the information needed to complete the form. 

In some instances, we may be contacted by certain Governmental institutions asking for clarity into termination / seperation reasons and agreements of a team member. Please forward these emails to the relevant People Business Partner that submitted the offboarding notification, as they will have full context into the reasons and agreements and will choose to respond if needed. 

#### Probation Period Rotation

The People Experience Associate in the `Probation Period` rotation, will complete the full process as per the steps listed in the [Probation Period](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#probation-period) section of the hanbook. If the weekly rotation has come to an end and not all confirmations have been received, the Associate in the next weeks rotation will follow up with team members managers.

#### Triage People Group Issues

The People Experience Associate in the 'triage' rotation will pull up all issues opened in the `General` project and tag / assign team members according to the request. It is important that once you have triaged the issue, to update the label from `workflow:triage` to `workflow:todo / doing`. 

#### Deleting Team Member Data from Letter of Employment Rotation

Once a week, the People Experience Associate in the `deleting team member data` rotation will delete team members data submitted on the Letter of Employment response spreadsheet for the previous week.

#### OSAT Team Member Feedback

Once a new team member has completed their onboarding, they are asked to complete the `Onboarding Survey` to share their experience. Based on the scores received, the People Experience Associate assigned to the specific team members onboarding, will complete the following:

- Score of 4 or higher: use own discretion based on the feedback received and see whether there are any improvements or changes that can be made to the onboarding template / onboarding process (this can be subjective). 
- Score of 3 or lower: reach out to the team member and schedule a feedback session to further discuss their concerns and feedback provided. 

#### Onboarding Buddy Feedback

In the same survey, new team members are able to provide a score and feedback on their onboarding buddy. If the score and feedback received is constructive and valuable insights when the score is low, the People Experience Associate assigned to that specific team members onboarding, should reach out to the manager of the onboarding buddy and provide feedback in a polite and supportive way.

Tip for Printfection Site: Star and bell the relevant campaigns applicable to our team for further ease to search for. 

#### Printfection Report for New Hire Swag

When a new team member starts, the New Hire Swag email is sent with a link to Printfection where new team members can order their swag. To keep track of the orders, the PEA will run a weekly report on Friday's. Please see the below steps on how to process the report:

Should the PEA find any abuse of the link, they will need to report to the Manager, People Operations as well as the Senior Manager of Brand Activation. 

#### HelloSign

As the DRI for HelloSign, when a team member needs to have access to sign documents for the company, an access request needs to be created and assigned to the People Experience Team for provisioning. Please ensure to first ask the team member whether they will be signing more than 5 documents per month before allocating a seat with HelloSign. 

- If no, then suggest the free version of HelloSign which allows the team members to signup and send up to 5 documents per month. 
- If yes, proceed with sending the team member an invitation to HelloSign as per the steps below: 

1. Log into [HelloSign](https://app.hellosign.com/home/) using your personal account information
1. Select `Team` on the left hand-side of the page
1. Insert the team members GitLab email address and click `Invite`
1. Take a screenshot of the confirmed invitation sent and upload to the Access Request as confirmation

### Monthly Billing

When monthly expenses are due, we need to be able to provide Finance with the specific team members name in order to assign to the correct Department. To do this we would need to complete the following steps:

1. Download the invoices from HelloSign which can be found under the 'Billing' section. 
1. Send a request to HelloSign Support on a monthly basis for the specific team members which the costs that have been charged, relates to. Often the response is not received in time for the monthly expenses. 
1. Once the list is received from HelloSign, simply send the Accounts Payable Specialist an email with the relevant team member information.  

### Regeling Internet Thuis form

New team members based in the Netherlands will send an email to people-exp@gitlab.com with the Regeling Internet Thuis form. The People Experience team will then forward this form to the payroll provider in the Netherlands via email. The contact information can be found in the People Ops 1Password vault, under "Payroll Contacts".

### Pulling Social Call Metrics 

The People Experience Associate will assigned to this task, will pull this report at the end of the month.

1. Open People Ops Zoom Account
1. On the right side, Under Admin > Click on Dashboard
1. Click on Meetings 
1. Select Past Meetings
1. Adjust the Calendar to reflect the timeframe (it will only work for one month) > Done
1. Type in the search bar the meeting ID - This can be found on the calendar invite. > Search

1. C+P this data into the `Social Call` tab in the All-Time Data for Take a Break-Social Call Google Sheet. This is saved People Experience Google Shared Drive. 

### Slack Admin

The People Experience team have admin access to Slack and can assist team members with any PTO queries as per the process listed on the PTO Handbook [page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#instructions-for-people-ops-and-total-rewards-to-update-pto-by-roots-events). 

The People Experience team will also receive notifications of any news items from Slack, as well as sync issues between BambooHR and PTO by Roots. When receiving the email about issues with the sync, the People Experience Associate will verify whether it is a specific issue or whether it is related to a recent offboarding of a team member or if it is related to team members starting that week. The sync takes about 24 hours when it will then update to remove/add the specific team members. 

### Access Request Templates

When a new tool is [added to the Tech Stack](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#adding-access-request-process-for-a-new-item-in-the-tech-stack), the People Experience team is automatically pinged in the Access Request to create the relevant MR adding the tool to the offboarding template. 

- Important to check whether the tool should be in the main offboarding issue or if only a certain department/team will have access to the tool, in which case, this can be added to the specific department template.
