# People Experience Team Processes
{: #People Experience Team Processes .gitlab-purple}

The People Experience Associate will attempt to solve queries within the specific time zones and relevant SLA's. 

If the People Experience Associate is unable to complete a specific/urgent task, please post in the private team Slack channel. Please handover any important tasks/messages to the next team member available. 

### Bi-Weekly Rotations 

Bi-Weekly, the People Experience Associate will open a [PEA Rotation Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Weekly-Rotation-PEA.md).. This rotation issue lists what tasks the PEA will be accountable for, for the next 2 weeks. 

The following factors are considered when allocating in the issue:
- Scheduled PTO 
- The listed Tasks are split fairly
- The use of PEA/POps Task Tracker to divide certain tasks

#### Allocations for Onboarding

- Not time zone specific to ensure that all Associates learn all aspects to different countries during onboarding. 
#### Who to Onboard 

Each time a new hire is successfully synced from Greenhouse to Workday, a notification is sent to the `#peopleops-alerts` Slack channel. The People Experience Associate in the applicable rotation, will then proceed with:

- Opening the profile in Workday
- Create an entry for the team member in the onboarding tracker, linking to the Workday profile
- Acknowledge the Slack notification (this shows that this has been processed)

#### Allocations for Offboarding

- Team has 12 hours to create and notify of the offboarding issue.
- Due to different time zones, the offboarding issue creation and task completion can be tagged team by the Associates. 

#### Allocations for Career Mobility 

- We always try and split evenly and fairly. 

### Audits for Compliance

#### Issue Audits

There are certain tasks that need to be completed by all the different departments and team members and we as the People Experience Team need to ensure to remain compliant in line with these tasks. Herewith a breakdown of the important compliance and team tasks:  

##### Onboarding
This will be the responsibility of the People Experience Associate that is assigned to the specific team members onboarding and should be completed prior to closing the issue.

    - Ensure that all the different departments complete their tasks within the 5 day due date. 
    - Ensure that the laptop has been wiped by the IT Ops team 
    - Ping the relevant team members to call for a task to be completed in the offboarding issue.

##### Career Mobility
This will be the responsibility of the People Experience Associate that is assigned to the specific team members career mobility issue and should be completed prior to closing the issue. 
    - Check to see whether the team member that has migrated needs any guidance.
    - Ensure that the previous manager and current manager completes their respective tasks - including linking the relevant access requests. 
    - The issue should be closed within 2 weeks of creation, ping the relevant team members to call for a task to be completed in the issue.


#### Emergency Contact Audit

The People Experience Associate in the respective rotation will send an email using the [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/email_templates/missing-emergency-contact.md) available to notify team members to add their Emergency Contacts.

### Onboarding Audit

Cadence: Each new joiner.

*** The People Experience Associates do not have full access to audit team members of the People Group. Please reach out to the Workday Admins for further assistance. 

#### Part 1: 

When a new hire is synced from Greenhouse to Workday, the People Experience team will receive a notification in Workday to verify all the information has been synced correctly by matching to the signed offer agreement.

#### Part 2:

This is a manual review of each new joiner's Workday profile that takes place within their first week of employment. This audit is intended to correct any profile errors and, for US team members only, to check that the I-9 has been completed and sort each team member into the correct Benefit Group. This task is handled by the respective People Experience Associate in the relevant rotation and completed on the "onboarding" tab in BambooHR.

##### Audit Steps in BambooHR


- Open the respective onboarding issue for the team member
- Log into Workday and check that team member has inserted their date of birth (check the information updates Inbox as there may be a pending request to update this information). Ping the team member on day 2 if this field has not been completed.
    - For US team members, ensure that the Social Security Number has been inserted correctly (xxx-xx-xxxx) (the dashes needs to be included to ensure that the sync to ADP happens with no issues)
- After verifying date of birth and SSN (if applicable), complete the following:

* Go to the team member’s Bamboo Profile > click “More” > Onboarding
* Import from template
* Go through each of the Onboarding Tasks
* **Note:** If the team member is a rehire, you will need to delete all the old onboarding tasks before the system will allow you to add the checklist items back on.

#### Audit Personal Tab

* DOB Audit: Check off if date of birth has been completed
* SSN Added?: Check off Social Security Number field (if applicable)
* GitLab Username: Check the GitLab username is correct in BambooHR by cross referencing the team members username in the onboarding issue. Update if not correct in BambooHR. The GitLab username is case sensitive but the `@` symbol is not necessary.

#### Audit Job Tab

* Start Date Audit: Documents tab > check that the signed contract is in the “Contracts & Changes” folder. 
   * Effective Date, Hire Date, Compensation & Job Information Effective Date, Employment Status: Check the hire date on the contract. If it is different, go back to the folder and search for a date change confirmation file (usually uploaded by Candidate Experience Specialist). 
   * If the signed letter is not in the folder: go to Greenhouse > search for team member > Activity Feed > Find CES > ping CES on Slack and ask for the date change confirmation to be uploaded.
* Division, Department, Cost Center: Should be the same as the manager’s.
    - ** Note in some instances the Department may differ to the managers. Please reach out to **BambooHR Provisioners** for further clarity if this should differ or whether this should be updated to match the manager. 
* Entity Check: Check to be sure that the team member was hired into the correct entity based on location and role. 
* [Payroll Type](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/): 
   - For all the entities the payroll type is Employee
   - For Remote and Global Upside it should be Employee-PEO
   - For Safeguard & CXC it should be Contractor-PEO 
   - For IT BV it should be Individual Contractor
* Audit Compensation:
   * Fill out the [onboarding calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pch83tg59hEC-xnAzMuAOd6Da5GOAsnFBQ-1HNPbjtI/edit#gid=0)
   * Cross-check calculator results against Compensation, Pay Frequency, On Target Earnings, Currency Conversion fields
   * For Non-Sales, “On Target Earnings” should say “No”, no need to add the date
   * Effective Date should be the hire date.
   * Exchange Rate Effective Date is going to be 2020-12-01 until we revisit this again in 2021
   * Equity: Audit Shares field against contract or Greenhouse details.
   * Job Information: cross-check against contract 
   * If title has a speciality, add it under “Job Title Speciality”, for example, “Backend Engineer, Verify” - “Backend Engineer” will go under “Job Title” but “Verify” will go under “Job Title Speciality”
* Audit Options and Job Codes: audit job title and job code against this [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wUIvWrjErlGIlRLANomwqrQYOHPsklggATFbo0lElpU/edit#gid=1539740034)


#### Audit Locality & Region

* Personal tab > Audit Locality to match the city: 
* Check if the locality is on Greenhouse (Candidate City + URL for compensation calculator). If not:
* Check [distance of city to locality on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/). Distance should not be more than 1 hour and 45 minutes during rush hour (8AM). Change the time to 8:00AM

   - **Note: Sales zone is not applicable within SA (formerly known as Customer Success) or Field Operations as location factor is applied - should read as n/a - comp calc**



#### Update GitLab and Turn off Notifications

* Go back to the onboarding issue of the team member >  complete the respective BambooHR related tasks 
* Turn off notifications for those team members that you aren't the assigned Experience associate for
* Be sure to update the onboarding audit label from `:: Waiting` to `:: Complete` 
* For **non-US team members**, there is no need to tag anyone from payroll in the issue

#### Only For US Team Members:

Wait for People Experience Team to tag you on the team member’s onboarding issue. Only audit the profile once the SSN has been added to the account. If not, comment on the onboarding issue and remind the team member on their 2nd day to add their SSN. 

**Additional steps to audit the profile of US team member:**

* SSN added?
   * Personal tab > make sure “National Identification Number Type” and “National Identification Number” are filled out
* I-9 Field
   * Personal tab > Once the SSN has been added, tick the I-9 Processed checkbox 
* Benefit Group

### Monthly Reporting

#### Retaining & Purging Form I-9

Per the [USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Service](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/retention-and-storage), form I-9, which is completed for all US-based team members, must be retained and purged according to the USCIS retention policies.

**Form I-9 must be retained as long as a team member is Active. If a US-based team member is Inactive, Form I-9 must be purged 3 years after a team member's start date _or_ 1 year after their departure date, whichever is later.**

Example 1: Team member Marie Curie's start date was 2017-01-01 and she departed the company on 2021-06-01. Her Form I-9 must be purged after 2022-06-01.

Example 2: Team member Matt Gandhi's start date was 2019-06-01 but he departed on 2019-12-15. His Form I-9 must be purged after 2022-06-01.

1. The People Experience team must run a monthly report in BambooHR to show all Inactive US-based team members and compare it to Guardian's Inactive team member report. 
1. The People Experience team confirm the correct purging dates in the Guarding report using the above formula to calculate how long Form I-9 must be kept for the relevant team members and then purge them after the calculated time period. 
1. When a team member has passed a purging date, the People Experience team must:

    - Login to Guardian and go to `Administration`.
    - Click on `Purge Data`
    - Select `Purge Employees & I9 Data` from the drop down
    - Click on the check box by the former team members name
    - Then click` purge` 
    - Review the team member's Verification folder in BambooHR to ensure that no form I-9 copies are present. Delete form I-9 if found. Receipt and confirmation of work eligibility do not need to be deleted.

### Letters of Employment and Employee Verification Requests

This lists the steps for the People Experience team to follow when receiving requests:

#### Letters of Employment 

Team Members are able to request a Letter of Employment using the [documented form](/handbook/people-group/frequent-requests/#letter-of-employment) for this purpose.  Once submitted they will receive an auto-populated document utilising the data housed in BambooHR i.e. compensation; length of tenure; nature of employment (full or part-time) etc. along with an indication that GitLab is an all remote company.

#### Employee Verifications

We may be contacted by different vendors who require a team members employment to be verified along with other personal information. 

Most importantly, check to see whether authorisation has been received from the team member that we may provide the personal information. If no authorisation form is attached, make contact with the team member via email or Slack to get the required consent. 
- If the vendor is asking for general information in the email, simply respond back to the email with the requested information. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed, complete the form via Docusign and encrypt the document before sending via email. 
- If the vendor is requesting a form to be completed for a US team member, forward this request on to the US Payroll team to have completed. 
- If you need additional figures that we do not have access to, send a message in the private `payroll-peopleops` Slack channel to request the information needed to complete the form. 

In some instances, we may be contacted by certain Governmental institutions asking for clarity into termination / seperation reasons and agreements of a team member. Please forward these emails to the relevant People Business Partner that submitted the offboarding notification, as they will have full context into the reasons and agreements and will choose to respond if needed. 

#### Probation Period Rotation

The People Experience Associate in the `Probation Period` rotation, will complete the full process as per the steps listed in the [Probation Period](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#probation-period) section of the Handbook. If the weekly rotation has come to an end and not all confirmations have been received, the Associate in the next weeks rotation will follow up with team members managers.

#### Netherlands Certification of Good Conduct (VOG) Report - check with Laura on reporting ****

THe first day of the month, the People Experience Associate in the assigned rotation, will ensure that the new Netherlands based team members hired in the previous month have uploaded their VOG. 

- There is a shared report in Workday called Netherlands VOG. Open that report.
**note** If need be, please adjust the dates by editing the report. 
- View the employees listed.
- Go to each team members profile, then to documents, then go to either employee uploads or contracts folder. Check for the letter.
- If there is no letter, please reach out to the team member to have them upload the letter. Once you receive confirmation that it has been uploaded, move it to the Background Check folder within the Contracts & Changes folder.

### OSAT Team Member Feedback

Once a new team member has completed their onboarding, they are asked to complete the `Onboarding Survey` to share their experience. Based on the scores received, the People Experience Associate assigned to the specific team members onboarding, will complete the following:

- Score of 4 or higher: use own discretion based on the feedback received and see whether there are any improvements or changes that can be made to the onboarding template / onboarding process (this can be subjective). 
- Score of 3 or lower: reach out to the team member and schedule a feedback session to further discuss their concerns and feedback provided. 

### Onboarding Buddy Feedback

In the same survey, new team members are able to provide a score and feedback on their onboarding buddy. If the score and feedback received is constructive and valuable insights when the score is low, the People Experience Associate assigned to that specific team members onboarding, should reach out to the manager of the onboarding buddy and provide feedback in a polite and supportive way.

### Printfection Report for New Hire Swag

When a new team member starts, the New Hire Swag email is sent with a link to Printfection where new team members can order their swag. To keep track of the orders, the PEA will run a weekly report on Friday's. Please see the below steps on how to process the report:

- Log into Printfection 
- Click Report at the top right corner
- Select Run Orders Report
- Select "Welcome New Hire" from the drop down on the left hand side of the page under Campaign
- Click Generate Report at the top of the page
- You can download the report as a CSV and compare the report to the new hires for the week on the Onboarding tab of the People Operations/People Experience Associate tracker.

Should the PEA find any abuse of the link, they will need to report to the Manager, People Operations as well as the Senior Manager of Brand Activation.  

### TaNewKi Call Invites

The PEA in the rotation should review the onboarding tracker and send [email invitations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/email_templates/tanewki_welcome_call.md) to new hires for the Ta'NEW'ki welcome call 2 weeks before their start date, if applicable.

Once a day, the PEA will review the [Google Form RSVP Responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PYxWM5JBvHcGK6yQ_HHcbLraAOnlzvJGgC1JSI48LZs/edit?resourcekey#gid=1801243759) to see if any new responses have come in. If they have, you'll add the email address to the selected TaNewKi call to provide those incoming team members with an invite on their calendar. 

### Regeling Internet Thuis form

Part of the onboarding process with HR Savvy, new team members based in the Netherlands will complete the Regeling Internet Thuis form. If this is not completed, the team member will send an email to people-exp@gitlab.com with the Regeling Internet Thuis form and respective invoice. The People Experience team will then forward this form to the payroll provider in the Netherlands via email. The contact information can be found in the People Ops 1Password vault, under "Payroll Contacts".

If a team members address changes or the amount changes, team members will need to send their updated Regeling Internet Thuis form to people-exp @gitlab.com, which the People Experience team will then forward to the payroll provider in the Netherlands.

### Pulling Social Call Metrics 

The People Experience Associate will assigned to this task, will pull this report the first week of the month.

1. Open People Ops Zoom Account
1. On the left side, Under Admin > Click on Dashboard
1. Click on Meetings 
1. Select Past Meetings
1. Adjust the Calendar to reflect the timeframe (it will only work for one month) > Done
1. Type in the search bar the meeting ID - This can be found on the calendar invite. > Search

1. C+P this data into the `New Format` tab in the All-Time Data for Take a Break-Social Call Google Sheet. This is saved People Experience Google Shared Drive. 
1. You will need to do this for each of the topics (Open Topic, Gaming, FitLab, Parenthood, Mental Health Social Hour) 
1. Lastly, you'll open up a [new issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) to summarize the metrics for the previous month tagging the whole team. 

### Slack Admin

The People Experience team have admin access to Slack and can assist team members with any PTO queries as per the process listed on the PTO Handbook [page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#instructions-for-people-ops-and-total-rewards-to-update-pto-by-roots-events). 

The People Experience team will also receive notifications of any news items from Slack, as well as sync issues between BambooHR and PTO by Roots. When receiving the email about issues with the sync, the People Experience Associate will verify whether it is a specific issue or whether it is related to a recent offboarding of a team member or if it is related to team members starting that week. The sync takes about 24 hours when it will then update to remove/add the specific team members. 

### Access Request Templates

When a new tool is [added to the Tech Stack](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#adding-access-request-process-for-a-new-item-in-the-tech-stack), the People Experience team is automatically pinged in the Access Request to create the relevant MR adding the tool to the offboarding template. 

- Important to check whether the tool should be in the main offboarding issue or if only a certain department/team will have access to the tool, in which case, this can be added to the specific department template. 

### Bonus Processing

Bonus Processing is completed by the Experience Associate who is on that rotation for the week via the issue. Below are the various types of bonuses that need to be processed.

#### Referral Bonuses

1. The Experience Associate on the bonus processing rotation will utilize the Workday report titled `GitLab Referral Bonus Audit` to process referral bonuses
1. The PEA should put in the start date range they are wanting to process (example: if I wanted to process June referral bonuses, I would input March 1st - March 31st into the report dates) and the report will be anyone who was hired within that month that has the `Referred by` filled in
1. Before the PEA processes the One Time Payment in Workday, they should check the Worker History to see if the referral bonus has already been added. If it has, then there is no further action to be done. 
1. If it hasn't, then process the One Time Payment

#### Discretionary Bonuses  - checking with Engineering ****

1. Discretionary bonuses go through approvals via the Nominator bot. The Experience team will be notified of bonuses that need to be approved in the private slack channel `people-group-nominator-bot`
1. The PEA should review the nomination based off the criteria [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/incentives/#valid-and-invalid-criteria-for-discretionary-bonuses) and make sure it's an appropriate bonus to approve - if there are any questions, make sure to ask for any clarification in the thread.
   - If for any reason, the bonus does not meet the criteria - reject the bonus in the slack channel and communicate to the nominator about why.
1. If the bonus meets the criteria, the PEA will approve the bonus in the slack channel and this feeds into Workday. You'll want to double check to make sure everything fed over correctly under the one time payment section. 
1. After confirming everything fed over from the bot to Workday, the PEA will add the bonus information to the appropriate payroll changes spreadsheet (US, Non-US, or Canada)
1. Lastly, add a checkmark or any other emoji onto the Approval in the bot to signal that you have in fact completed this nomination and it's been processed.

_Note: If you received the same nomination twice (for the same person and the same reason), you may reject one. When you do this, please reach out to the team member (and respective PBP) who submitted the nomination to explain, and include the other nominator's name in the #team-member-updates announcement See more details in section for [multiple discretionary bonuses](/handbook/incentives/#multiple-discretionary-bonuses)._
