### OOO Handover Process for People Experience Team

1. The People Experience Associate will create a document the day before their scheduled OOO with the following:
- What urgent tasks are there that need to be reassigned:
* Onboarding
* Offboarding
* Career Mobilities
* Any other tasks
- Is there anything else that we should be made aware of and contribute to whilst you are away?
2. The People Experience Coordinator will then reassign tasks to an alternative People Experience Associate.
3. Get assistance from the People Operation Specialist team if additional hands are needed.

### OOO Process for People Experience Coordinator

1. When the People Experience Coordinator is due to be OOO, the People Experience Associates will allocate the relevant tasks between themselves.
2. In the event that there are items that need urgent attention whilst the People Experience Coordinator is OOO, the Coordinator will hand over the relevant tasks to the People Experience Team Lead or People Experience Associates.

## People Experience Team Processes

### Weekly Rotations 

The People Experience Team are currently trialling a task rotation on a weekly basis. The allocation tracker can be found in the [People Exp/Ops Tracker]. This will initially be trialed on a weekly rotation and then possibly moved to monthly. 

A task will be allocated based on a ongoing team member rotation between all People Experience Associates. 

The following factors will also be taken into consideration:

- Scheduled PTO for the team members
- Ensure that the tasks split evenly and fairly 
- A tracker will be kept to track the data of how the tasks are split up

The Rotation groups are listed as follows:

- Letters of Employment / VOE / OSAT Feedback
- Probation / Anniversary Queries / Gift Requests
- BHR Onboarding Report / Moo Report
- Allocations for Onboarding / Offboarding / Mobility

#### Allocations for Onboarding

- We always try and split evenly and fairly
 


#### Allocations for Offboarding

- Team has 12 hours to create and notify of the offboarding issue
- The person that is in the allocation rotation will also add the offboarding to the PEA team calendar


#### Allocations for Career Mobility 



### Audits 

There are certain tasks that need to be completed by all the different departments and team members and we as the People Experience Team need to ensure to remain compliant in line with these tasks. Herewith a breakdown of the important compliance and team tasks:  

- Onboarding

This will be the responsibility of the People Experience Associate that is assigned to the specific team members onboarding. 

    - Ensure that the new team member has shared a screenshot of their FileVault disk encryption and computer serial number in the onboarding issue. 
    - Ensure that the new team member has acknowledged the 'Handbook' compliance task in the onboarding issue. 
    - Ensure that the manager tasks are completed prior to and after the new team member has started. 
    - Ensure that an onboarding buddy has been assigned to assist the new team member. 
    - Ping the relevant team members to call for a task to be completed in the onboarding issue.

- Offboarding

This will be the responsibility of the People Experience Associate that is assigned to the specific team members offboarding. 

    - Ensure that all the different departments complete their tasks within the 5 day due date. 
    - Immediate action is required from the People Experience Team and the IT Ops Team once the issue has been created. 
    - Ping the relevant team members to call for a task to be completed in the offboarding issue.

- Career Mobility 

This will be the responsibility of the People Experience Associate that is assigned to the specific team members career mobility issue. 

    - Check to see whether the team member that has migrated needs any guidance.
    - Ensure that the previous manager and current manager completes their respective tasks. 
    - The issue should be closed within 2 weeks of creation, ping the relevant team members to call for a task to be completed in the issue.


**Over and above these audits, the Compliance Specialist will perform their own audits to ensure that certain tasks have been completed.**

### Gift Requests

When a team member completes the GitLab gift form request, the People Experience team receives an email to people-exp@domain.com to process the request. Most often, these are requests for flowers to be sent to another team member. Please see the below steps for guidance on how to process these requests:

- Navigate and open the gift form requests in `Google spreadsheet`. 
- Open the PeopleOps 1Password Vault and select `Gift & Flower Vendors` to gain access to the various vendors used. 
- Place order and once confirmed, add data, including order confirmation link, to spreadsheet. 
- Send the requesting team member an email or message in Slack to confirm that you have processed the request/order. 
- Use the Gift [page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#gifts) in the Handbook for any further information regarding the policy for gift order requests. 


### Scheduling Group Conversations 

The People Experience team assists with the administration of the GitLab Team Calendar and automatically can assist with the following:

- Scheduling new Group Conversations or AMA's
- Assist with updating the calendar when Group Conversations are rescheduled

Here are the steps to follow when scheduling a Group Conversation or AMA:

1. Log into the PeopleOps Shared Zoom Account via Okta
1. Select 'Schedule a New Meeting'
1. Insert the name of the conversation under 'Topic'
1. Below the date and time option, select 'Recurring Meeting'
1. Under the 'Recurrence' dropdown, select 'No Fixed Time'

1. You are also able to add any alternative hosts in the event that the People Group will not be assisting with moderating the call. 
1. Click 'Save'
1. Once saved, select the option to 'Add to Google Calendar'
1. You will be redirected to the Google Calendar and prompted to select a calendar. Select your own account.

That's it, you have successfully scheduled the meeting! Now just remember to let the requesting team member know to check that it has been done so correctly. 


### HelloSign

As the DRI for HelloSign, when a team member needs to have access to sign documents for the company, an access request needs to be created and assigned to the People Experience Team for provisioning. 

#### Process once Access Request is received:

1. Log into [HelloSign](https://app.hellosign.com/home/) using your personal account information
1. Select `Team` on the left hand-side of the page
1. Insert the team members GitLab email address and click `Invite`
1. Take a screenshot of the confirmed invitation sent and upload to the Access Request as confirmation

#### Monthly Billing

1. When monthly expenses are due, we need to be able to provide Finance with the specific team members name in order to assign to the correct Department. To do this we would need to send a request to HelloSign Support on a monthly basis and often the response is not received in time for the monthly expenses. Once the list is received from HelloSign, simply send the Accounts Payable Specialist an email with the information.  


### Regeling Internet Thuis form

New team members based in the Netherlands will send an email to people-exp@domain.com with the Regeling Internet Thuis form. The People Experience team will then forward this form to the payroll provider in the Netherlands via email. The contact information can be found in the People Ops 1Password vault, under "Payroll Contacts"
