## What is Career Development

It is the lifelong process of managing learning, work, leisure and transitions in order to move toward a personally determined and evolving preferred future.

Watch this live speaker series where we talk to Leah Weiss of [Skylyte](https://www.skylyte.com/) about the connection between wellbeing, purpose, and our career growth.

### Roles and Responsibilities

Team Member Owned
 - Take charge of your own development and career
 - Close the skill gap for current and future positions
 - Seize development and stretch opportunities
 - Remember there are no promises or guarantees of a promotion

Manager Facilitated
- Take time with team members to discuss their career aspirations
- Listen and provide feedback, ideas and contacts
- Make choices to support their development

GitLab Supported
- Communicate future direction and skills requirements
- Provide information and tools when applicable
- Communicate internal opportunities

70-20-10 Rule for Development
- 70% of your development should come from on-the-job and action learning.  This can include development experiences like managing a project, serving on a cross-functional team, taking on a new task, job shadowing, job rotation, etc.
- 20% of your development should come from interactions with others.  This includes having a mentor, being a mentor, coaching, participating in communities of practice, serving as a leader in your organization, etc.
- 10% of your development should come from training, including classes, seminars, webinars, podcasts, reading, conferences, etc. Here is an example of the Enablement stage's process for applying for the [professional development budget](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/processes/budget_approval.html).

Additional Questions to Think About
- Do you have any overused strengths or underdeveloped skills that might cause your career to stall or derail?
- Considering feedback from others, are you perceived to have the skills required for the business needs of the future? If not, how could you shape that perception in a favorable direction?
- How can you leverage your current skills and talents for your future aspirations?
- What skills or talents are missing to qualify you for your future aspirations?
- Does your feedback from others tell you anything about how feasible your aspirations are?
- Do you currently have the skills and talents needed for the future business needs?  If not what can you do now to get ready?

### The Relationship Between Learning and Development and Promotion

As is highlighted in our [Leadership](/handbook/leadership/1-1/#key-points) section, GitLab team members should not feel pressure to climb the proverbial ladder. We recognize that not everyone wants to advance or move to a new level, and that is supported. Developing one's skills and promotion at the company are not mutually exclusive.

It is perfectly acceptable to seek out learning and development opportunities — to sharpen one's understanding of a coding language to better understand a function, etc. — yet not strive for promotion beyond your current role. Some team members are happier and more productive without managing a team, for example.

As detailed in GitLab's [Definition of Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging ](/company/culture/inclusion/), we recognize that unique characteristics and experiences form how we as individuals approach challenges and solve problems. They also shape how we view success in our individual careers and lives. Not everyone views promotion as a measure of success, and team members will not be thought less of or penalized for holding this view.

As part of GitLab's [Transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency) value, team members are encouraged to be open and honest with their manager. You are encouraged to learn and develop your skills without pressure to in turn seek promotion. If you feel you are not being supported in this way, please visit the [Need Help?](/handbook/people-group/#reach-peopleops) portion of the People Group Handbook.

## Internal Resources

### Recorded Workshops

During our Career Development workshops at Contribute, May 2019 we took team members through tips to creating a clear growth (aka development) plan. Below are the resources from that session:

- [Career Development Workshop, slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yY0ofMGgzN07ylTAnRP5geFnWcgUYkiVlcIyR54tpD0/edit#slide=id.g29a70c6c35_0_68)

- [Individual Development Plan in Security](/handbook/engineering/security/individual-development-plan.html)

### Internal Opportunities to expand exposure

There are various internal opportunities to expand a team member's exposure to multiple parts of the organization.  These include:

- Participation in a [Team Member Resource Group (TMRG)](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/)
- Work on a [Working Group (WG)](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/)
- Do an [apprenticeship](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/career-development/#apprenticeship-for-learning) on another team
- Apply to do the [CEO shadow program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/shadow/) for two weeks
- When appropriate and possible, attending some of the staff meetings of the team members manager's manager

### Internship for Learning

If your manager has coverage, you can spend a percentage of your time working (through an 'internship') with another team.

This could be for any reason: maybe you want to broaden your skills or maybe you've done that work before and find it interesting.

If your team has someone working part-time on it, it's on the manager of that team to ensure that the person has the support and training they need, so they don't get stuck. Maybe that's a buddy system, or maybe it's just encouragement to use existing Slack channels - whatever works for the individuals involved.

#### How does this work?

**What percentage of time should be allocated?** Well, 10% time and 20% time are reasonably common. As long as you and your manager have the capacity the decision is theirs and yours.

**What about the team losing a person for X% of the time? How are they supposed to get work done?**
Each manager needs to manage the capacity of their team appropriately. If all of the team are 'at work' (no one is on PTO, or parental leave, or off sick), and the team still can't afford X% of one person's time - that team might be over capacity.

**Can I join a team where I have no experience or skills in that area?**
That's up to the managers involved. It may be that the first step is to spend some time without producing anything in particular - in which case, it's possible that the [Growth and Development Benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-benefit) may be a better fit (or it might not.)

**How long does an internship of this nature last?**
This will vary from team to team, but typically 6 weeks to 3 months depending on the goals for your internship.

**This sounds great but how do I initiate this process?**
First step is to discuss this with your manager at your next 1:1. Come prepared with your proposal highlighting what skills you want to learn/enhance and the amount of time you think you will need. Remember, this should be of benefit to you and GitLab. You and your manager will need to collaborate on how you both can make this happen which may also involve discussing it further with the manager of the team you may be looking to transfer to. All discussions will be done transparently with you. Be mindful though that the business needs may mean a move can't happen immediately.

**How do I find a mentor?**
On the [team page](/company/team), you can see who is willing to be a mentor by looking at the associated [expertise](/company/team/structure/#expert) on their entry.

**Does completing an internship guarantee me a role on the team?**
Completing an internship through this program does not guarantee an internal transfer. For example, there may not be enough
allocated headcount in the time-frame in which you complete your internship.

If at the end of your internship, you are interested in transferring teams please follow the guidelines in [Internal Department Transfers](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#internal-department-transfers).

#### Starting Your New Internship

Please create a new issue in the [Training project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/Training/issues/new), choose the `internship_for_learning` template, and fill out the placeholders.

No internship for learning should be approved without both managers having a conversation and agreeing upong the percentage of time the team member will spending on the internship. Also, the team members manager may has discretion not to approve the internship for learning if there are team member performance issues.

Once you've agreed upon the internship goals, both managers should inform their respective groups' People Business Partner.

#### Recommendations

We recommend that, at any given time, each [team](/company/team/structure/#team-and-team-members) is handling only one intern. This is to allow for an efficient and focused mentorship without impacting the capacity of the team. You can, of course, adjust this depending on the size of the team but please consider the impact of mentoring when scheduling internships.

## Tracking your Career Development

### Individual Growth Plan 

The [Individual Growth Plan (IGP)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjdIuK5mNpljiHnFMK4dvqfTOzV9iSJj66OtoYbniFM/edit) is a great way to take initiative of your career growth. 

Maybe you aren't sure where to start or you are having trouble filling out your IGP, we recommend watching the [How to Develop your Career Plan](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/how-to-develop-your-career-plan/introduction?u=2255073) course on LinkedIn Learning. 

Steps: 
1. Open the [Individual Growth Plan (IGP) Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjdIuK5mNpljiHnFMK4dvqfTOzV9iSJj66OtoYbniFM/edit)
1. Make a copy of the template + save to your drive
1. Fill out the template 
1. Review with your manager 
1. Start working towards your goals!

### Tracking your Accomplishments 

Some people may call it a "brag sheet" some call it a CREDIT Tracker, either way, it's a great place to put all of your accomplishments and positive feedback. We encourage you to utizlize the Accomplishment tracker in conjunction with the IGP and GitLab Epics. 

Steps: 
1. Go to the [Accomplishment Tracker Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBjEbX-p4MYinEsdU-91KDQ_BJkihwrBKZ0n9yfdLjo/edit?usp=sharing)
1. Make a copy + save to your drive
1. Start filling it out (check out the video below for a walkthrough)

### Health Tracker: Growth Plan

Consider making a copy of this [Google sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pr_yl8TRAXucSr4qYml6TdsO86PgiaKB/edit#gid=2104005676) to track the current status and long term goals you've set for both your personal and professional growth.

### Use GitLab Epics to track your career development

Epics are a great way to [transparently](/handbook/values/#transparency) and [efficiently](/handbook/values/#efficiency) track your work and map learning back to your [results](/handbook/values/#results).

Here are some ways you can use Epics when organizing your career development work. Here are two examples from the Learning and Development team: [Example 1](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/43), [Example 2](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/47)

Below is a short video from the L&D team reviewing how and why you might choose to use epics for career development tracking:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xuisSgBQtaU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

1. Open an epic in a personal or team project
1. Use the description to highlight your learning goals, ideal programs or resources you want to review, considerations when planning, etc.
1. Open issues to track actions you'll take as a result or inspriationo of learning resources you've used
1. Add those issues as related to your epic. If you can't add the related issues becuase they are in differnet projects, consider starting a new thread in the epic that links to any and all issues that are a result of, or impacted by, your career development work

### Career Mapping and Development
{:#career-mapping-and-development}

We have started this process at GitLab by defining Junior, Senior and Staff advancement levels. Career Mapping helps GitLab team-members to understand and develop the skills they need to achieve their goals, giving them clear criteria.
Mapping helps managers and leaders internally develop the skills and knowledge they need to achieve future business goals. The key to this is to identify the key skills, knowledge, and abilities needed to master each level. Another essential tool is a career development plan, here are some examples:

- [Career Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJIzMnVhEz3X4k24oAwNnlgGhBeQ518Cps9kLVRRoWQ/edit)
- [Template  - Development Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DBrukzzsV6InaCkZf8_ngLeTcLQ9uj6ynE93qLmHkQA/edit#gid=1677297587)
- [Career Plan Template](https://performancemanager.successfactors.com/doc/po/develop_employee/carsample.html)

Managers should discuss career development at least once a month at the [1:1](/handbook/leadership/1-1/) and then support their team members with creating a plan to help them achieve their career goals. If you would to know more about this please checkout the [career mapping course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZH5Hhygc4)

#### Recomendations for Managers to support the learning of team members

Managers should support their direct reports with career and professional development goals. Managers can help direct reports by implementing the following into their [1-1](/handbook/leadership/1-1/), team meetings, and async communications. 

- Encourage team members to incorporate learning and professional development into their [Individual Growth Plan](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internal-resources-1) or using [Gitlab Epics to track career development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#use-gitlab-epics-to-track-your-career-development). 
- Utilize the [Growth & Development Benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/) for professional development opportunities
- Ensure that direct reports prioritize learning, and support different learning styles: 
     - Recommend blocking time to take [time out to learn](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign). This can be on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis; whatever works best for the reports learning goals. 
    - Organize communities of learning within your team and cross-functional ones to encourage [social learning.](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#social-learning-through-live-learning)
    - Be the example for your team by sharing career and professional development pursuits you are currently looking into and completing in synchronous and asynchronous communications. 
- Create a team or functional [Learning Hub](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/work-with-us/#creating-a-learning-hub-for-your-team) on [GitLab Learn](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/) to organize team learning paths and activities to promote self-service and self-paced learning. 
    - Curate content in GitLab by reviewing offerings in [LinkedIn Learning](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/linkedin-learning/), the Handbook, external vendors, and open-source material that apply to the role and skills needed for the team. 
    - Document learning in a centralized knowledge base in GitLab Learn and a Handbook page. 

### Career Development Conversation Acknowledgements

Career development is a key factor in team member engagement and role satisfaction. As part of the FY'20 GitLab annual [engagement survey results](/handbook/people-group/engagement/) it was clear that team members want to have meaningful conversations with their managers on an annual basis or even more frequently. Starting in FY'22 we will be tracking career development conversations via BambooHR. 

### Cadence

This process is just an acknowledgement by the team member that they have had career conversations. Aligned with the Performance/Potential [matrix cadence](/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#regular-cadence), formal career conversations will ideally happen twice per year:

* Once in Q2
* Once in Q4

The bi-annual cadence is not required, but recommended. Some team members may prefer annual career conversations, other team members may prefer more informal check-ins quarterly. This is a personal decision that should be made between team member and manager. The minimal recommended cadence for career development conversations is annnually, the most frequency recommended cadence is quarterly. 

### Process 

_Please note that while managers can facilitate career development conversations with team members and help guide growth plans by using our [internal resources](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internal-resources),  managers cannot complete the acknowledgement process for team members. The team member is responsible for the acknowledgement in BambooHR._

Starting FY'22 (exact date is TBD) team members will receive a notice via BambooHR to acknowledge that a career conversation has occurred. By signing the acknowledgement you are confirming that you have indeed had a career development conversation during the specified time period (Q2 or Q4 respectively).

*  This is not mandatory, however we highly encourage all team members to discuss their career goals with their manager.
*  There is not one right way to document a career development conversation. Some team members may use their 1:1 document to capture the conversation and actions, others may use the [tools provided above](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internal-resources) to help guide the conversation, or a team member may use their own personal template or process to have a career development conversation.
*  There is no timeline or deadline on this process, however, the goal is for all team members to acknowledge at least one career development conversation in FY'22. 
*  If you have not had a career conversation yet it is up to you to schedule a time to review and discuss with your manager.  
*  If you are new to GitLab the recommendation is that you start career conversations after your first 90 days.
*  Career conversations should not be confused with promotion conversations. Team members who do not want to increase their scope of work or be promoted, but are performing, should not feel pressured to move up or out. Career conversations can also focus on helping team members identify projects or other activities that keep the team member engaged and learning new skills. _Please note that development can also include lateral moves, or moving to another speciality within the same job family and job level._

## E-Group Performance Enablement Review

Effective FY21, each member of the E-Group will have a performance conversation with their direct manager, the [CEO](/company/team/#sytses), at the beginning of the new fiscal year. These conversations will assess alignment to each of our [credit values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#credit), performance and personal development.
 
The E-Group will follow a similar process to our GitLab team member process with the additional requirement of a [self review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pi-nv6NtMejosVOXlr1O4rZGxmGUzuN01OMnXn5dxKU/edit#). 

**Performance Factors**

- Developing in role i.e. you are new to company / new to role  or there is performance development required
- Performing in role i.e. you are meeting all requirements
- Exceeding in role i.e. you are knocking it out of the park

**Compensation Reviews**

When conducting compensation reviews for the E-Group, GitLab will review two items: 
1. Alignment to market rates 
1. Performance factors
