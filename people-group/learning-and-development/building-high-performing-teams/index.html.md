## Introduction

One of the greatest challenges for leaders is to build and develop high performing teams. This page explores what it means to have a high performing team at GitLab. It will also explore a tactical roadmap called the Drexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model that managers can reference to build high performing teams. 

## What Makes a High Performing Team at GitLab

Through various interviews with executive leadership and managers at GitLab, we have identified a series of skills, behaviors, and attributes of high performing teams at GitLab. Many of these points are in alignment with our values. To operate as a team in a remote environment, trust needs to be at the center of the formation of the team. Additional skills, behaviors, and attributes of high performing teams include: 

- Handbook first approach
- Shared desire to grow others
- High Level of self-awareness
- Living our values
- Strong sense of ownership by individual team members
- Ego's are put into check
- Ability to see viewpoints from different perspectives
- Bias towards action
- Asynchronous communication practices
- Iteration, breaking down complex information into digestible parts 
- Trust-based relationships where everyone is open to provide feedback

## Strategies to Improve Building High Performing Teams 

The [Drexler-Sibbet Team Performance Model](https://www.kaizenko.com/drexler-sibbet-team-performance-model/) is an excellent tool to help build high performing teams at GitLab. The model provides a roadmap for a team and a common language. It is a simplified description of how a team works together that highlights the most important things the team needs to focus on to reach high performance. At GitLab, we can use it as a frame of reference to developing high performing teams. It can help Managers ensure new and existing team members know the mission and direction of the team by the following: 
- To form your team
- To guide what your team does
- To monitor how well your team is doing
- To diagnose where your team may be struggling or identify the keys to your team's success

Let's explore the stages in more detail and strategies you can implement as a Manager in building a high performing team. 

**7 Stages to developing high performing teams:**
1. **Orientation** - Why are we here? Team members need to see a sense of team identity and how individual team members fit in. 
2. **Trust Building** - Who are you? Team members share mutual regard for each other and are open and supportive of trust-based relationships. 
3. **Goal Clarification** - What are we doing? Assumptions are made clear; individual assumptions are made known with a clear vision of the end state. 
4. **Commitment** - How will we do it? Team members understand how it will make decisions and do the work. 
5. **Implementation** - Who does what, when, where? Team members have a sense of clarity and can operate effectively due to the alignment of shared goals.
6. **High-Performance** - Wow! The team is accomplishing more than it expected. The team has taken off, creativity is fostered and goals are surpassed. 
7. **Renewal** - Why continue? The team is given recognition and celebrates achievements of individuals that produce valuable work. Reflect on lessons learned and reassess for the future.

### Stage 1 Orientation - Why am I here?

Why am I here? Team needs to move from complete freedom to a set of “boundaries and constraints” that are needed to operate. The first step is to understand the purpose of the team. 
- The first step of orientation is to understand the purpose of the team. Why does the team exist and what is expected of it? 
- Team members need to see a sense of Team Identity in relation to the team. 
- Membership has to do with understanding how you fit in on the team. New team members may be asking - “How can I make a difference on this team?” 
- Unresolved orientation stage can include disorientation, uncertainty, and fear and can prevent trust-building. 

**Questions that need to be answered in Stage 1:** 

- Why does the team exist?

- Is the work valuable and meaningful to me?
