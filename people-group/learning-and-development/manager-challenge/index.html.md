## Introduction

Welcome to the GitLab Manager Challenge page. We rolled out the first iteration of the 4 Week Manager Challenge in September 2020, "The GitLab Manager Challenge Program." The Learning and Development Team has iterated on the program and designed a new curriculum that incorporates elements of [Leadership](/handbook/leadership/) and the book [High Output Management](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#books) 

L&D will be rolling out another iteration during the month of January 2021. The program will start 2021-01-11 If you are interested in participating in January, you can [sign up on this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/issues/21). Please note that if you plan on participating you will need to dedicate at least 20 to 30 minutes each day on the content as well as attend or watch recordings of the live learning courses.  

All details relating to the program can be found on this page.

The program is intended to build a set of baseline skills that complement our values to enable Managers to lead teams at GitLab.

## Learning and Development Team 

### Organizing Epics and Issues 

The Manager Challenge Pilot is set up within the GitLab Tool. We are using Epics, Sub Epics and Issues. There is one main Epic for the whole program, a Sub Epic for each week, and then an Issue for each day. 

**Example of Manager Challenge Pilot Set Up:**

[Manager Challenge Pilot - Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/1)

[Week 1 - Manager Challenge Pilot - Sub Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/2)

[Manager Challenge Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge)

[Manager Challenge Program Pilot: Day 1 - Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/issues/1)

**Learning & Development Team Tasks** 

- A Week before the program starts: 
   - Create the Epic: Manager Challenge - [Month] [Year] 
   - Create the Sub Epics for each week: Manager Challenge - Week 1 
- Daily
   - Create the Day's Issue in the [Manager Challenge Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge) using the [manager-challenge-daily-template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/manager-challenge-daily-template.md) 
   - Monitor the issue comments to respond to questions as well as keep track of participation 

### Communication 

The modes of communciation during the challenge include Slack and GitLab. Ensure that there is a specific channel in Slack set up for challenge memebers, as well as a group tag in GitLab. 

Each day, once the issue is opened, add the group tag to the issue so participants recieve an email notification that the daily issue is ready. For the pilot, the tag was `@gl-manager-challenge-pilot`. 

The Slack channel for the pilot program was `#manager-challenge-pilot`. Each day, once the issue was opened, a message was posted in the slack channel with a link to the day's issue. 

### Scheduling 

**Live Learning Sessions** 

Each week of the challenge has one day of live learning sessions. Depending on the locations of the participants, it can be determeined how many sessions are held on the Thursday of each week.  

Approximate times for the live sessions to ensure timezone coverate include: 10:30am ET, 4pm ET, and 9:30pm ET. 

### Retrospective Sessions

After the 20 day challenge has been completed, it is suggested to have a live retrospective where participants can come and share any feedback about the program. The time(s) this is scheduled for can be the same as the live learning sessions were during the challenge. 

For the pilot Manager Challenge program, the Learning & Development team held a [retrospective session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecuYFRA2oMqpXbGeaK-VIB8AeX98dJJ2-W-wcYUzaXg/edit?userstoinvite=nadia%40gitlab.com&ts=5f7eb88b) to discuss with participants how we can iterate and improve the program moving forward. [Anonymous feedback and ratings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iUqcs-kSmXf1ol_lio7TJYcn7VHEGHrNcacW3KQwyKg/edit#gid=314035882) were captured throughout the pilot challenge.
