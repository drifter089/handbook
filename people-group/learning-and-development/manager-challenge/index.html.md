## Introduction

Welcome to the Manager Challenge page. We are rolling out a pilot version of a 4 Week Manager Challenge in September 2020, "The GitLab Manager Challenge Program." All details relating to the challenge can be found here on this page. The first iteration of the program will be a pilot to a subset of team members at GitLab. Once the pilot has concluded, we will roll out the program to the broader GitLab community!

## FAQs

1. **What is required of me?**
     - Monday to Wednesday there will be a series of daily challenges that a manager can complete asynchronously on their own time that will cover a range of topics. On Thursday's we will come together as a group in a live learning session to apply the challenges to real scenarios managers face in a remote environment. 
1. **I have a lot of management experience, will this help?**
     - No matter your level or tenure as a manager, we can all take time out of our busy days to grow our management and leadership skills. The more practice the better and we hope that you will find the challenges applicable to your job.
1. **What skills will I be building?**
     - You will be building a range of skills that include: coaching, managing underperformance, crucial conversations, feedback, building an inclusive culture, developing high performing teams, and much more!  
1. **How does this complement our values?**
     - All of the challenges will reinforce our values by applying management techniques to lead others in a remote environment.  
1. **Is the content in the slides in the Handbook?**
     - Yes! All of the content will be in the Handbook. We are creating Google Slides to visualize the content for the challenges but all of it will live in the handbook. 
1. **What if I canâ€™t attend a Live Learning session or complete a challenge?**
     - If you miss a challenge or live learning session you can go back and complete the challenge anytime. Each SSOT page for material covered will be linked on this page. The live learning recordings will be on the respective SSOT page (ex. the recording for the Week 3 Trust & Coaching session will be on the [Coaching page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/coaching/)). 
1. **What if I am out of office for part of the program?**

1. **I'm not a Manager, can I still participate?**
     - Yes, you can still participate but we ask that you complete the activities asynchronously for your own professional development. Once you are ready to become a manager, you will be equipped with a set of baseline management skills. 
1. **How do I receive a certification?**
     - Yes! Once you complete all challenges, attend the live learning sessions, and complete the self-reflection activities, you will receive the "GitLab Managers Challenge" certificate.
