## Introduction

Welcome to the Manager Challenge page. We are rolling out a pilot version of a 4 Week Manager Challenge in September 2020, "The GitLab Manager Challenge Program." All details relating to the challenge can be found here on this page. The first iteration of the program will be a pilot to a subset of team members at GitLab. Once the pilot has concluded, we will roll out the program to the broader GitLab team!

### Manager Challenge Learning Objectives

You may be asking yourself what you will achieve by taking part in the Manager Challenge program. Our goal is that participants walk away with the following skills after completing the four-week challenge: 
- Improve your performance by strengthening your management skills
- Develop a management style that incorporates a whole-person approach to leading others
- Handle difficult management situations with greater certainty in your decisions
- Use emotional intelligence to improve leadership and build more effective relationships
- Build an inclusive environment for your people that is built on trust
- Grow and strengthen skills in leading remote teams at GitLab

### Overview

**What** 

The Four Week Manager Challenge Program is a blended learning approach that incorporates self-paced daily challenges and live learning sessions to build foundational management skills. The program incorporates leadership assessments, interactive live learning sessions, and digital learning. 

**Why** 

The program is intended to build a set of baseline skills that complement our values to enable Managers to lead teams at GitLab. To date, there has not been a formal GitLab Manager training program and this will serve as our first iteration. 

**How will it help**

Learn the basic principles of what it means to be a manager using a whole person approach to leadership. The program was built to incorporate themes identified during interviews with team members and managers at GitLab. 

**What do I need to do**

Set aside time each day to participate in the challenge (20 minutes) and live learning sessions (1 hour). Complete the weekly self-evaluations and comment in the Slack channel during discussions. As a participant in the pilot program, your feedback is critical for our success so please make time to complete the weekly evaluations.

## Learning and Development Team 

### Organizing Epics and Issues 

The Manager Challenge Pilot is set up within the GitLab Tool. We are using Epics, Sub Epics and Issues. There is one main Epic for the whole program, a Sub Epic for each week, and then an Issue for each day. 

**Example of Manager Challenge Pilot Set Up:**

[Manager Challenge Pilot - Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/1)

[Week 1 - Manager Challenge Pilot - Sub Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/2)

[Manager Challenge Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge)

[Manager Challenge Program Pilot: Day 1 - Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/issues/1)

**Learning & Development Team Tasks** 

- A Week before the program starts: 
   - Create the Epic: Manager Challenge - [Month] [Year] 
   - Create the Sub Epics for each week: Manager Challenge - Week 1 
- Daily
   - Create the Day's Issue in the [Manager Challenge Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge) using the [manager-challenge-daily-template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/manager-challenge-daily-template.md) 
   - Monitor the issue comments to respond to questions as well as keep track of participation 

### Communication 

The modes of communciation during the challenge include Slack and GitLab. Ensure that there is a specific channel in Slack set up for challenge memebers, as well as a group tag in GitLab. 

Each day, once the issue is opened, add the group tag to the issue so participants recieve an email notification that the daily issue is ready. For the pilot, the tag was `@gl-manager-challenge-pilot`. 

The Slack channel for the pilot program was `#manager-challenge-pilot`. Each day, once the issue was opened, a message was posted in the slack channel with a link to the day's issue. 

### Scheduling 

**Live Learning Sessions** 

Each week of the challenge has one day of live learning sessions. Depending on the locations of the participants, it can be determeined how many sessions are held on the Thursday of each week.  

Approximate times for the live sessions to ensure timezone coverate include: 10:30am ET, 4pm ET, and 9:30pm ET. 

**Retrospective Sessions**

After the 20 day challenge has been completed, it is suggested to have a live retrospective where participants can come and share any feedback about the program. The time(s) this is scheduled for can be the same as the live learning sessions were during the challenge. 

For the pilot Manager Challenge program, the Learning & Development team held a [retrospective session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecuYFRA2oMqpXbGeaK-VIB8AeX98dJJ2-W-wcYUzaXg/edit?userstoinvite=nadia%40gitlab.com&ts=5f7eb88b) to discuss with participants how we can iterate and improve the program moving forward.
