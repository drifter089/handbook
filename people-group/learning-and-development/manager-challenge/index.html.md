## Introduction

Welcome to the GitLab Manager Challenge page. The Learning and Development Team has iterated on the program and designed a new curriculum that incorporates elements of [Leadership](/handbook/leadership/) and the book [High Output Management](/handbook/leadership/#books/). L&D will be rolling out a **three-week iteration of the program** during the month of January 2021. **The program will start 2021-01-11 If you are interested in participating in January, you can [sign up on this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/issues/21)**. Please note that if you plan on participating you will need to dedicate at least 20 to 30 minutes each day on the content as well as attend or watch the 50-minute recordings of the weekly live learning courses.  

One of the biggest benefits of completing the program is **Learning From Other Managers** across GitLab. Networking and async collaboration with learning is a central theme throughout the three-weeks. 

We rolled out the first iteration of the [4 Week Manager Challenge in September 2020](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/1), "The GitLab Manager Challenge Program." The pilot received a [Net Promoter Score of 4.6](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11J1b8jwxROFYH4Xgylkhgo6x3OEm4kyB?ths=true) by the participants. 

All details relating to the next iteration of the Manager Challenge program can be found on this page.

### Manager Challenge Learning Objectives

You may be asking yourself what you will achieve by taking part in the Manager Challenge program! Our goal is that participants walk away with the following skills after completing the four-week challenge: 
- Improve your team performance by strengthening management skills
- Develop a management style that incorporates a whole-person approach to leading others
- Apply and learn GitLab Leadership best practices into your management role
- Demonstrate the application of High Output Management principles 
- Evaluate difficult management situations with greater certainty in your decisions
- Practice emotional intelligence to improve leadership and build more effective relationships with your people
- Build an inclusive environment for your people that is built on trust

### Overview

**What** 

The Three Week Manager Challenge Program is a blended learning approach that incorporates self-paced daily challenges and live learning sessions to build foundational management skills. The program incorporates leadership assessments, interactive live learning sessions, and digital learning. 

**Why** 

The program is intended to build a set of baseline skills that complement our values to enable Managers to lead teams at GitLab. 

**How will it help**

Learn the basic principles of what it means to be a manager using a whole-person approach to leadership. The curriculum was built using principles from the book High Output Management, interviews with senior leaders, and GitLab management practices. 

**What do I need to do**

Set aside time each day to participate in the challenge (20-30 minutes) and live learning sessions (50 minutes). Complete the weekly learning evaluations, comment on the challenge issues, and fill in the Manager Action Plan. If you are unable to prioritize the training for the 3 weeks, please consider signing up for a session at a later date or discuss additional options with the L&D team. In addition, there will also be async learning options for participants that are unable to attend the live learning sessions.

### Post Manager Challenge

L&D is continuing to iterate on continuing education opportunities to build management skills for leading remote teams at GitLab. For the January 2021 Challenge, we will be piloting [Trust Metryx](https://www.xmetryx.com/) to participants that are interested in trying out the tool. 

Trust Metryx is a behavioral change software that accelerates the development of remote team leaders. It helps leaders build trust and create lasting change by reducing friction, lowering stress, and improving performance. 

The tool accelerates your development as a manager/leader by: 
- Helping you to identify behaviors that get in the way of team performance wellbeing
- Making it easy for leaders to excel at guiding your team to create the small behavioral nudges that drive continuous improvement
- Enabling you to track your progress creating an inclusive team culture built on trust by providing a specific measurable outcome in terms of team relationship strength
- Also includes **Coach in the Cloud** - a library of behavioral science-based micro-courses and team relationship coaching. Coach in the Cloud helps you develop the skills to navigate relationship challenges and lead with Trust. 

TrustMetryx compliments and builds on the basic principles of what it means to be a manager using the whole-person approach to leadership covered in the Manager Challenge. TrustMetryx gives you a data driven approach to ensuring that you’re embracing GitLab values and creating an inclusive team culture built on trust.

**What do I need to do?**
More information will be included as the January challenge approaches!

## Learning and Development Team 

### Organizing Epics and Issues 

The Manager Challenge Pilot is set up within the GitLab Tool. We are using Epics, Sub Epics, and Issues. There is one main Epic for the whole program, a Sub Epic for each week, and then an Issue for each day. 

**Example of Manager Challenge Pilot Set Up:**

[Manager Challenge Pilot - Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/1)

[Week 1 - Manager Challenge Pilot - Sub Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/2)

[Manager Challenge Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge)

[Manager Challenge Program Pilot: Day 1 - Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/issues/1)

**Learning & Development Team Tasks** 

- A week before the program starts: 
   - Create the Epic: Manager Challenge - [Month] [Year] 
   - Create the Sub Epics for each week: Manager Challenge - Week 1 
- Daily
   - Create the Day's Issue in the [Manager Challenge Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge) using the [manager-challenge-daily-template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/manager-challenge-daily-template.md) 
   - Monitor the issue comments to respond to questions as well as keep track of participation 

### Communication 

The modes of communication during the challenge include Slack and GitLab. Ensure that there is a specific channel in Slack set up for challenge members, as well as a group tag in GitLab. 

Each day, once the issue is opened, add the group tag to the issue so participants receive an email notification that the daily issue is ready. For the pilot, the tag was `@gl-manager-challenge-pilot`. 

The Slack channel for the pilot program was `#manager-challenge-pilot`. Each day, once the issue was opened, a message was posted in the Slack channel with a link to the day's issue. 

### Scheduling 

**Live Learning Sessions** 

Each week of the challenge has one day of live learning sessions. Depending on the locations of the participants, it can be determined how many sessions are held on the Thursday of each week.  

Approximate times for the live sessions to ensure timezone coverage include: 10:30 am ET, 4:00 pm ET, and 9:30 pm ET. 

### Retrospective Sessions

After the challenge has been completed, it is suggested to have a live retrospective where participants can come and share any feedback about the program. The time(s) this is scheduled for can be the same as the live learning sessions were during the challenge. 

For the pilot Manager Challenge program, the Learning & Development team held a [retrospective session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecuYFRA2oMqpXbGeaK-VIB8AeX98dJJ2-W-wcYUzaXg/edit?userstoinvite=nadia%40gitlab.com&ts=5f7eb88b) to discuss with participants how we can iterate and improve the program moving forward. [Anonymous feedback and ratings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iUqcs-kSmXf1ol_lio7TJYcn7VHEGHrNcacW3KQwyKg/edit#gid=314035882) were captured throughout the pilot challenge. Each week participants filled out a learning evaluation form for the weekly challenges and overall program.
