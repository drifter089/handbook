## Introduction

Leadership Chats are monthly calls for people leaders at GitLab. The goals of these synchronous sessions include:

1. Provide a safe space for managers at GitLab to connect across teams about leadership topics
1. Build connections and mentor relationships between new and existing managers
1. Ease transition for new managers into their roles
1. Increase collaboration and coaching across teams on common and difficult issues that managers face
1. Encourage social conversations about topics outside of work
1. Provide continuous social learning opportunities to participants following the manager challenge program

Some topics that managers can expect to discuss during these sessions include:

1. Challenges faced as a manager of a all-remote team
1. Crucial conversationsL: how to have them, what works, what doesn't
1. Work and life balance as a manager
1. Professional development as both a manager and for direct reports
1. Enabling GitLab culture
1. Relationship and trust building
1. And more!

All people leaders at GitLab are invited to join these calls. The sessions will not be recorded or shared.


## Background

Lean Manager Coffee Chats have historically been a place for managers at GitLab to get together and have conversations about crucial conversations, challenges, and joys of being a people leader. These conversations were held using a [lean coffee structure](https://theagileist.wordpress.com/2019/01/31/remote-retrospective-using-lean-coffee/) with topics generated by team members on the [manager lean coffee chat issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/leaders-leancoffee-topics/-/boards/965643).

Towards the end of 2020, the Learning and Development team began to brainstorm ideas for how these calls can continute to serve managers at GitLab, especially upon completion of the [manager challenge program](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-challenge)


## Meeting cadence

Leadership Chats are hosted 1x per month, with 2-3 sessions each time to accommodate multiple time zones. 2x per quarter, these calls are lead by managers attending the call. 1x per quarter, the Learning and Development team will facilitate the conversation.

These calls will kick off starting in February 2021. This first session will be facilitated by the Learning and Development team. From this kick off, the rotation of 1x L&D lead, followed by 2x manager lead, will begin. The meetings rotate on multiple days of the week to better accommote multiple schedules. 

We hope that managers can find a day or time at least 1x per quarter to attend!

| Month | Week and Day | Conversation Type |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st month of the quarter | Third Wednesday | L&D led conversation |
| 2nd month of the quarter | Third Tuesday | independent manager conversation |
| 3rd month of the quarter | Third Thursday | independent manager conversation |


## Attendance

The Leadership Chats conversations are added to the GitLab Team calendar. If you're having trouble finding the meeting, please reach out to the L&D team in the [learning and development Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CMRAWQ97W) for support. 

Since the meetings are not recorded, you can review the [meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hq9CykJn3EvYI5XblntORSIaheCdmyqYsqiHdrlHbHE/edit) to catch up on missed conversations.

### How to propose a conversation idea

If you have an idea or topic you'd like to discuss during these conversations, please open an issue on the `management-leancoffee-topics` [issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/leaders-leancoffee-topics/-/boards/965643) and add the `new-topics` label. 

Please review the current topics for overlap. If you find a topic you are also interested in that you'd like to discuss, you can vote on the issue using the `thumbs-up` emoji.

### How are meeting topics choosen?

Before each Leadership Chat session, the L&D team will populate the agenda with 3-5 topics for discussion. If your group of managers feels strongly about one of these topics, run with it! If you'd rather discuss something else, that is okay, too! These topics are meant to help get discussion going and are not required.

If you have an idea you feel strongly about that you'd like to discuss, please add it to the [meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hq9CykJn3EvYI5XblntORSIaheCdmyqYsqiHdrlHbHE/edit) for the session you plan to attend.

### After the meeting
