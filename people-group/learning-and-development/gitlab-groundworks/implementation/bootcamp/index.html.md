# EdCast LXP Bootcamp

## Training Structure

### HPA Training Site

EdCast uses their platform to organize and deliver training content to members of the core team in a learning platform called HPA. If new members are onboarded to GitLab and need to access training materials in HPA, they should work with the core team and EdCast account manager to be authenticated.

Core team members can access the HPA learning materials at [https://hpa.edcast.com](https://hpa.edcast.com/).

All bootcamp content from the HPA is also accessible to GitLab team members only via Google Drive. We've listed each training below with a brief explanation of the content covered in each training.

### Training Sessions

The GitLab team meets with the EdCast team frequently to train and implement the system. The following meeting formats are used to collaborate:

- Weekly Standup Meetings: Hosted one time per week by EdCast, these meetings are meant to be a short, 30 mintute check in and update on progress made and questions to address
- Weekly Implementation Status Meeting: Hosted one time per week by EdCast, these meetings are meant to review blockers, address big questions, and determine next steps in implementation
- Daily GitLab Huddle: Hosted one time per day by EdCast, these meetings are meant to be working Q&A sessions with the EdCast team and are optional.
- Marketplace Meetings: The Professional Services team meets with EdCast to train on and implement the EdCast Marketplace features for external audiences
- Additional Meetings: Individuals or small groups with specific use cases may host additional trainings and meetings with EdCast

If you would like to be added to any of the implementation meetings, please reach out to the core team in the [#proj-lxp-edcast Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C010VVAT48Y).

### GitLab Bootcamp Directory

In addition to HPA and the bootcamp Google Drive, the [GitLab Bootcamp Topic Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nSRNQljFvxOaiADcG97AFYrAj_6b5vcXI0O9vDDF2TM/edit#gid=3560912) serves as a resource to organize training recordings and can be viewed by GitLab team members.

### Team Communication
