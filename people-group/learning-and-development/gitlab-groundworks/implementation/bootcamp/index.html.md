# EdCast LXP Bootcamp

## HPA Training Site

EdCast uses their platform to organize and deliver training content to members of the core team in a learning platform called HPA. If new members are onboarded to GitLab and need to access training materials in HPA, they should work with the core team and EdCast account manager to be authenticated.

Core team members can access the HPA learning materials at [https://hpa.edcast.com](https://hpa.edcast.com/).

All bootcamp content from the HPA is also accessible to GitLab team members only via Google Drive. We've listed each training below with a brief explanation of the content covered in each training.

### GitLab Bootcamp Directory

In addition to HPA and the bootcamp Google Drive, the [GitLab Bootcamp Topic Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nSRNQljFvxOaiADcG97AFYrAj_6b5vcXI0O9vDDF2TM/edit#gid=3560912) serves as a resource to organize training recordings and can be viewed by GitLab team members.
