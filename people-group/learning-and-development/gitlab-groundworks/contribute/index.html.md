## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Create and Curate Learning Content

1. Make a contribution to the handbook. All learning content in the LXP is built with a handbook first approach. This means that information you'd like to add to the LXP must be stored first in the handbook. If you have not made a contribution to the GitLab handbook before, please review [how to contribute to GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/). 

The table below should be used as a reference for suggested handbook sections where learning content can be uploaded. If you aren't sure where to contribute learning content in the handbook, please review the [main handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#introduction) or contact the Learning and Development team at `learning@gitlab.com` for support.

| Content | Suggested Handbook Location |
| ----- | ----- |
| Leadership: emotional intelligence, coaching, and all other factors that contribute to growing and developing as a leader at GitLab | [Leadership Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/) |
| Communication: effective communication strategies, remote commiunication, and any additional content that contributes to strengthening asynchronous and remote communication skills | [Communication Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/) |
| Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging: inclusivity trainings, strategies for developing a sense of belonging, and content related to implementing DIB initiatieves | [DIB Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/) | 

1. If the content you'd like to contribute to the LXP is already included in the handbook - great! Your contribution to the LXP could be a new or creative curation of existing content from GitLab that helps a learner better understand a topic or reach a goal. Consider curating current content from the handbook, [GitLab YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg), and [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/). Consider taking the opportunity to add to or update existing content before contributing to the LXP.

### Step 2: Propose Content to be included in the LXP

1. Using the descriptions above, decide which content type might be the best fit for the information you'd like to contribute. Navigate to the corresponding creator kit and review the spcific 

### Step 3: Iterate on content with GitLab team via issues

### Step 4: Content is uploaded to the LXP
