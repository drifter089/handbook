# Contribute to GitLab Groundworks

## Best Practices


### Handbook First Learning Content

### Contribution Examples


## Learning Content in the LXP

EdCast organizes content in the LXP in three major types of content buckets. When contributing to the LXP, it's important to consider which of these three types might be best to organize content and guide learners to their learning objectives.


### SmartCards



#### Examples of SmartCard content

- Links to GitLab handbook pages, documentation pages, and YouTube videos
- Links to external articles and resources that can supplement handbook resources
- Advertising/sharing a live Learner Speaker Series being hosted for GitLab team members, or a public AMA with our Product team
- Polling a group of users to get their feedback on an interactive course on Emotional Intelligence
- Assessing learnings with a short quiz/knowledge check after reading a set of handbook pages
- Space for learners to upload and share submissions to projects, like a slide deck or animated video they've created

### Pathway



#### Examples of Pathway content

- A set of 6 handbook pages (SmartCards) reader's should review in sequence to gain a stronger understanding of one topic.

### Journey



#### Examples of Journey content

- A set of multiple pathways a user must work through in order to earn a certificaiton, for a course like GitLab 101 or GitLab 201.



## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Create and Curate Learning Content

1. Make a contribution to the handbook. All learning content in the LXP is built with a handbook first approach. This means that information you'd like to add to the LXP must be stored first in the handbook. If you have not made a contribution to the GitLab handbook before, please review [how to contribute to GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/). 

The table below should be used as a reference for suggested handbook sections where learning content can be uploaded. If you aren't sure where to contribute learning content in the handbook, please review the [main handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#introduction) or contact the Learning and Development team at `learning@gitlab.com` for support.

| Content | Suggested Handbook Location |
| ----- | ----- |
| Leadership: emotional intelligence, coaching, and all other factors that contribute to growing and developing as a leader at GitLab | [Leadership Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/) |
| Communication: effective communication strategies, remote commiunication, and any additional content that contributes to strengthening asynchronous and remote communication skills | [Communication Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/) |
| Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging: inclusivity trainings, strategies for developing a sense of belonging, and content related to implementing DIB initiatieves | [DIB Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/) | 

1. If the content you'd like to contribute to the LXP is already included in the handbook - great! Your contribution to the LXP could be a new or creative curation of existing content from GitLab that helps a learner better understand a topic or reach a goal. Consider curating current content from the handbook, [GitLab YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg), and [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/). Consider taking the opportunity to add to or update existing content before contributing to the LXP.

### Step 2: Propose Content to be included in the LXP

1. Using the descriptions above, decide which content type might be the best fit for the information you'd like to contribute. Navigate to the corresponding creator kit issue template and begin to populate the issue with required content.

**Note:** In order for content contributions to be reviewed by the appropriate GitLab team, all information on the issue template must be addressed. GitLab team members may ping you to address content gaps or answer questions about your contributions. 

### Step 3: Iterate on content with GitLab team via issues

1. After all required content is uploaded to the correct creator kit issue, GitLab team members will collaborate with contributors to iterate on and refine contributions. The following chart highlights which GitLab teams will collaborate on and approve content contributed to the LXP:

| Contributor Audience | Team Approval | DRI GitLab Handle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| GitLab Team Members | L&D Team | |
| Customers | Professional Services | |
| Partners | Partner Enablement | |
| Sales Team | Field Enablement | |
| Wider GitLab Community | Community Relations Team | |


To learn more about the admin review and approval process of contributions to the LXP, please review the LXP admin section of the handbook.

1. The GitLab team will determine when your contributions are ready to be added to the LXP and will communicate with contributors on related issues.


### Step 4: Content is uploaded to the LXP

1. The GitLab team members outlined above will upload related content to the LXP. Additional context about this admin process can be found in the LXP admin section of the handbook.

**Note:** At the GitLab team's discretion, individual contributors may be given permissions to upload content to the LXP.
