GitLab uses [EdCast](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-groundworks/) as a learning experience platform to create engaging learning opportunities. 

The following resources can be used by learners in the EdCast platform to help navigate the login process, explore new content, and more.

## EdCast User Documentation

### First time login to the EdCast platform


### Getting familiar with the platform

### Setting up your profile page

### Finding new learning content


## Frequently asked questions


### When will content in EdCast be available for the entire GitLab team, customers, and community members?

### How often should I access the LXP?

### Is there a limit to the amount of content I can learn on the LXP?

### Where is the content in the LXP stored?

Content in the LXP is developed using a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/interactive-learning/) approach. All learning content is stored in the handbook. Teams at GitLab use additional tools like Articulate360 and Rise to build interactive courses.

In addition to GitLab learning material stored in the handbook, GitLab team members will have access to off the shelf learning opportunity from other vendors and organizations, like LinkedIn Learning and WILL Learning.

### How can I contribute to the LXP?
