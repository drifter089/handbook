Learning material is built and organized in the LXP to help you follow a clear path. This is created using Smartcards, Pathways, and Journeys. More information on this content can be found on the [EdCast contribution page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-groundworks/contribute) and in [this video training](ADD TRAINING LINK)

| EdCast Content | Purpose | Example |
