GitLab uses [EdCast](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-groundworks/) as a learning experience platform to create engaging learning opportunities. 

The following resources can be used by learners in the EdCast platform to help navigate the login process, explore new content, and more.

## EdCast User Documentation

### First time login to the EdCast platform

When you first log into the LXP, a series of questions will lead you through your account setup. It's important to answer these questions, as the platform will use your answers to suggest new learning content based on your interests and expertice.

## Frequently asked questions


### When will content in EdCast be available for the entire GitLab team, customers, and community members?

The LXP implementation team is planning a phased rollout of the platform to multiple GitLab audiences. Progress and additional information can be found on the [LXP implementation issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/edcast-lxp-implementation/-/boards)

### Where is the content in the LXP stored?

Content in the LXP is developed using a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/interactive-learning/) approach. All learning content is stored in the handbook. Teams at GitLab use additional tools like Articulate360 and Rise to build interactive courses.

In addition to GitLab learning material stored in the handbook, GitLab team members will have access to off the shelf learning opportunity from other vendors and organizations, like LinkedIn Learning and WILL Learning.

### How can I contribute to the LXP?

The contribution process to the LXP is being built, and you can follow updates in the [learning and development handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-groundworks/contribute/).

### How often should I access the LXP?
