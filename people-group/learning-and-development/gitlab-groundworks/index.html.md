# [NAME OF LXP]

## What is EdCast?

GitLab uses EdCast to host our learning experience platform (LXP). At GitLab, we belive [everyone can contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/#mission), and our LXP is no different. Everyone can contribute to the EdCast LXP.

You can read more about the mission and vision of EdCast on the [EdCast About Page](https://www.edcast.com/corp/about-us/)

### What is a Learning Experience Platform (LXP)?

A learning experience platform, or LXP, is [defined by EdCast](https://www.edcast.com/corp/blog/what-is-an-lxp/#:~:text=It%20brings%20together%20internal%2C%20external,the%20content%20to%20the%20user.) as a platform that "brings together internal, external, formal and informal sources of learning and knowledge in a simple, easy to use interface (UI), driving an intuitive user experience (Ux).  A key feature is that an LXP should use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to personalize the content to the user. An LXP should be available on the web, and on a mobile device, anytime, anywhere."


## Handbook first approach to the LXP

The GitLab LXP uses a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) approach for all learning content, using the handbook as our single source of truth for learning content. Learners in the LXP will use the platform to find and curate relevant content that exists in the handbook.
