# [NAME OF LXP]

## What is EdCast?

GitLab uses EdCast, a Learning Experience Platform (LXP). At GitLab, we belive [everyone can contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/#mission), and our LXP is no different. Everyone can contribute to the LXP! 

You can read more about the mission and vision of the LXP on the [EdCast About Page](https://www.edcast.com/corp/about-us/)

### What is a LXP?

A learning experience platform, or LXP, is [defined by EdCast](https://www.edcast.com/corp/blog/what-is-an-lxp/#:~:text=It%20brings%20together%20internal%2C%20external,the%20content%20to%20the%20user.) as a platform that "brings together internal, external, formal and informal sources of learning and knowledge in a simple, easy to use interface (UI), driving an intuitive user experience (Ux).  A key feature is that an LXP should use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to personalize the content to the user. An LXP should be available on the web, and on a mobile device, anytime, anywhere."

### What will the LXP do for the GitLab community

GitLab has invested in the LXP to enable our team members, partners, customers, and the broader community a personalized, self-service leaning platform to enable handbook first continuous learning. The LXP will do the following for GitLab: 

- **Aggregate** all knowledge and learning content into one system for easier accessibilitiy 
- **Curate & Create** content that is [handbook first with interactivity](/handbook/sales/field-operations/field-enablement/interactive-learning/)
- **Recommend** learning based on individual community member preferences
- **Learn & Guide** community members on how to develop new skills through step-by-step guides through individual learning styles
- **Automate** learning for personalized learning recommendations
- **Scale** learning to the wider GitLab community
- **On-Demand**, **Self-Paced** learning
- **Reduce** manual tasks associated with scaling
- **Enhance** training to be delivered in a fun and engaging way (erase your preconceived notions of LMS or LXP systems!)
- **Dogfood** the same LXP system that will be used for customer training offerings


## Handbook first approach to the LXP

The GitLab LXP uses a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) approach for all learning content, using the handbook as our single source of truth for learning content. Contributors to the LXP will use the platform to [find and curate](/handbook/sales/field-operations/field-enablement/interactive-learning/) relevant content that exists in the handbook using a structured process.
