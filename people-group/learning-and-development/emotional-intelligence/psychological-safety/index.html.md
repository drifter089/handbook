## Introduction

On this page we are going to review psychological safety and it's importance for successful teams. 

## What is Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is [defined by Amy Edmondson](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2666999?seq=1) as a “shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking”.

It's not about being warm and fuzzy and sharing your feelings. It's about being comfortable admitting when you are wrong or have made a mistake as well as challenging each other for the better. 

Watch the video below where Susan David explains psychological safety.

Psychological safety has impacts on diversity and inclusion in organizations. Even if an organization has diversity, it doesn't mean that inclusion is present as well.
