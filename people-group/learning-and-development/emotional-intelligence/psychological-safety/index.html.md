## What is Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is [defined by Amy Edmondson](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2666999?seq=1) as a “shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking”.

It's not all about being warm and fuzzy and sharing your feelings. It is about being comfortable admitting when you are wrong or have made a mistake as well as challenging each other for the better.
