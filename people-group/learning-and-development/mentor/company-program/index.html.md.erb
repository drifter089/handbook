## GitLab [Mentorship](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/) Program 

The Learning and Development team is piloting the first company-wide mentorship program in FY23 Q1. This program is inspired by the success from the [Minorities in Tech Mentoring Program](/company/culture/inclusion/erg-minorities-in-tech/mentoring/) and the [Women's at GitLab mentorship program](/company/culture/inclusion/tmrg-gitlab-women/mentorship-program/).

Learn more about the purpose and results of mentorship in the [mentor handbook](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#what-is-mentoring)

## Program Structure

**Initial program kickoff**

A 25-minute discussion panel with mentors, mentees, and company leadership. Attendance is **required**.

**1:1 Mentor Sessions**

Mentors and mentees will meet every other week for ~30-minutes for a total of 5 months (with the option to extend). Sessions are led by the mentee and should be focused on specific goals. Attendance is **required**.

**Mentor/Mentee Workbook**

[Async resources](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#mentoring-resources) are available as a training guide for all mentor/mentee pairs. These resources include suggested articles to read and discuss, strategies for goal setting and sample meeting agendas. Use of resources is encouraged but not required.

**Mentor/Mentee Training**

Completion of the self-paced [How to be a Good Mentor or Mentee](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/how-to-be-a-good-mentee-and-mentor/the-power-of-mentoring?u=2255073) course on LinkedIn Learning is **required** of all mentors and mentees. If you prefer text-based learning or don't have a LinkedIn Learning license, you can instead review [these slides](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#mentor-and-mentee-training) based on the LinkedIn course.

**Monthly Office Hours**

Monthly office hours will be held by volunteer leaders in the program. These office hours will be 25 minute meetings and provide space for mentors and mentees to network, ask questions, and update their professional developpment plans. Attendance is **optional**

When mentorship pairs are created, the L&D team will ask for volunteers from different timezones to host these sessions. Hosting the session is a great leadership opportunity for both mentors and mentees. If you're interested in being an office hours host, please reach out to the L&D team in Slack.

**End of Program Celebration**

A 25-minute discussion to reflect on the experience. Attendance is **optional**.

## Metrics and Outcomes

Mentors and mentees will complete a pre-program and end of program survey to collect feedback, assess skills, and determine if goals set during mentor/mentee relationships have been set.

Success of this program will be measured by:

1. percentage of mentor/mentee pairs who meet consistently on a bi-weekly basis, with a goal of 95% completion
1. attendance to live training sessions, with a goal of 95% attendance
1. quality of feedback of the program from both the mentor and mentee perspective
1. percentage of mentee goal achieved during mentorship, as reported by mentees with a goal of at least 50% of goal achieved
1. mentor and mentee career development at GitLab after program conclusion including rates of promotion, transfer, and retention


## FAQ

**Can I participate as both a mentor and a mentee?**

Yes, this is a possibility. It's important that team members talk with their managers to discuss their capacity to participate in both roles in this program. Participation in both roles will require a 2hr commitment per month (two 30 minute sessions as a mentor and two 30 minute sessions as a mentee).

It's possible that we will have a shortage of mentors and be unable to complete all mentor/mentee pairs. If there is a shortage of mentors and you've applied as both a mentor and a mentee, you will be assigned **only** as a mentor in this program. 

**I'd like to participate but I can't commit the entire length of the program. Can I still apply?**

If you cannot commit to the 3 month program, please consider applying for a future mentorship program at GitLab. It's important that both mentors and mentees are available for the full 3 month program to achieve the best results.

**I'm not eligible to be a mentor or a mentee in this program. What are my options for future participation?**

Team members are always encouraged to build mentor/mentee relationships independently. You can find resources and a list of available mentors in the [Learning and Development handbook](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/)
