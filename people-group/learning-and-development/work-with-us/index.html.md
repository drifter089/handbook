| Support Model | When to use this process |
| ----- | ----- |
| Hosting a Live Learning event | You'd like to **host** an internal Live Learning session |
| Creating a new learning pathway | Create a new learning pathway or course for any audience |
| Uploading to GitLab Learn | Add new or existing learning content to the GitLab Learn LXP |
| Integrating external content to GitLab Learn | Add off-the-shelf learning from another provider to GitLab Learn |
| Requesting content review | L&D review of your learning content for handbook first, adult learning theory, and bias for async alignment |
| Requesting new content creation | You'd like the L&D team to **create** or **host** learning content for your team |


### Host a Live Learning event

Anyone at GitLab should feel empowered to host a learning session. Why would you want to host a live learning event? Maybe **you** are the expert on something. Or maybe you just want to learn more about a specific topic and share those learnings with more people. 

To host a live learning event, start by opening an issue in the Learning and Development [general project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues) using the `live_learning` template. All steps should be outlined on this template.  

**Examples of past Live Learning events**: 
- [Introduction to Coaching](/handbook/leadership/coaching/#introduction-to-coaching-1)
- [Being an Ally](/company/culture/inclusion/being-an-ally/#ally-training)

### Creating a new learning pathway

Anyone team at GitLab is encoruaged to build new learning pathways. Some scenarios where you might want to build a pathway include:

1. Create career development path for your team
1. Build a training for external audiences on your role
1. Teach the GitLab team how to efficiently solve a common problem, like troubles with Merge Requests or strategies for async communication
1. Organize content you've found externally, like articles, videos, or podcasts

To create a new learning pathway and to add that pathway to GitLab Learn, start by opening an issue in the Learning and Development [general project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues) using the `new_pathway` [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/new#). All steps should be outlined on this template.  

**Examples of learning paths in GitLab Learn

1. Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Certification
1. GitLab 101 and GitLab 201
1. Bias for Asynchronous Communication
