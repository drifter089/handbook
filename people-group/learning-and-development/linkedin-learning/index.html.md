## Overview

In January 2021, GitLab implemented LinkedIn Learning to provide our team members with more off the shelf learning resources. With a growing company, the needs for learning are growing as well and we are excited to provide this opportunity to our team members.  

## Benefit of LinkedIn Learning

Utilizing LinkedIn Learning will be beneficial to your professional development. With access to LinkedIn Learning, you will be able to access over 8,000 courses on many different topics. 

### How to incorporate LinkedIn Learning into your day-to-day role 

We encourage all team members to [take time out to learn](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign). If you are working on a project and realize you need to know more about a certain topic or a certain tool, you can go to GitLab Learn and search for LinkedIn Learning couses to see if there are resources avialble to you. 

### Take Time out to Learn

You can take time to learn about something that will help you in your current role. You can learn about things that can help you in a future role (maybe you are an aspiring manager). You can learn more to improve current skills or learn entirely new skills. You can also take time to learn about things that are fun for you like graphic design, drawing, or mindfulness. 

Finding courses and skills to learn just got easier with access to LinkedIn Learning. We have a [take time out to learn campaign](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign) where we encourage our team members to take time out of their work week to learn. Focus Fridays create designated meeting-free space within our weeks and are a great opportunity to take time out to learn. 

## Recommended Learning Paths

We have outlined recommended LinkedIn Learning paths for different roles at GitLab. These links will take you to GitLab Learn and if you decide to take the course it will open a new tab for the course in LinkedIn Learning. This is not an exhaustive list, but it is a good start if you are new to using the tool.

## LinkedIn Learning Cohorts

Self-organizing a cohort to complete a LinkedIn Learning course together can be a great way to keep each other accountable, discuss your learning, and connect with new team members. Similar to our [book clubs](/handbook/leadership/book-clubs/), we encourage team members to organize LinkedIn Learning cohorts to learn together.

Use this checklist when organizing your LinkedIn Learning cohort. Here is an example of how the [GitLab Women TMRG organized and implemented a LinkedIn Learning cohort](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/women-tmrg/-/issues/10).

1. Organize a cohort of learners. Consider reaching out to your team, the #what's-happening-at-GitLab channel, or a TMRG you're part of. Pose the opportunity to learn together and see what response you get!
1. Explore courses on LinkedIn Learning. We have suggestions on this page for all team members, but feel free to get specific in an area you're passionate about!
1. Vote or decide on a cousre to take together. 
1. Set a completion goal. Be realistic with how much time you have to learn each week. Consider a 2 or 3 month completion goal.
1. Decide how you want to collaborate. You may want to meet bi-weekly to discuss synchronously or use issues to collabrate async.
1. Build your learning pathway in GitLab Learn. Curate existing LinkedIn Learning SmartCards into the pathway you'd like to create. Consider adding a badge to the pathway as well. Documentation for building pathways can be found in our [GitLab Learn admin docs](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/)
1. Choose a facilitator. This facilitator is expected to organize discussion issues, set due dates, and send preriodic reminders to the cohort to keep members accountable
1. Create a temporary Slack channel. This space can be used as a place to remind members about upcoming deadlines, plan synchronous calls, and ask questions. 
1. Have a celebration! When you've completed the course, consider having a celebration to recap your learning, share takeaways, and recognize your accomplishments. Share your takeaways and badges on your LinkedIn profile if you'd like!
