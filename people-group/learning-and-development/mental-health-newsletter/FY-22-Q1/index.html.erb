Thanks for taking time to read the first quarterly Mental Health newsletter from the GitLab Learning and Development team!

After hosting [Mental Health Awareness week](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/12/21/gitlab-mental-health-awareness-week-recap/) at the end of 2020, we heard from the GitLab team that a continued conversaion about mental health would help provide resources, encourage conversation, and avoid burnout long-term.

In an effort to consistantly support team members in addressing signs of burnout, we hope this newsletter will

1. Highlight resources you can access as a GitLab team member to support your mental health
1. Organize external resources we think you might find helpful
1. Encoruage you to have conversations about mental health, taking time off, and managing burnout with your team and colleagues
1. Empower managers to support their team members 

## GitLab Resource Feature

[GitLab Paid Time Off Policy](/handbook/paid-time-off/)

Taking time off is important for managing burnout, and returning to work after a holiday or extended bread can feel overwhelming.

If you haven't recently reviewed our PTO policy, here are a few key points to review:

1. [A GitLab team member's guide to time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off)
1. [Communicating your time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off)
1. [Covid-19 medical leave policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/covid-19/#covid-19-medical-leave-policy)

It's important to remember that [rest and time off is productive](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#rest-and-time-off-are-productive). In December, we welcomed John Fitch, co-author of [Time Off](https://www.timeoffbook.com/), for a live speaker series discussing how time off can be used as a tool to manage burnout.

During the interview, John touches on the following topics:

1. Examples of how taking time off can look and feel, and the positive impact this time has on our overall work performance mental health
1. How managers can support and lead team members to take time off
1. Strategies for returning from time off to make the most of the perspectives and time for reflection you've gained

## Manager resources

- Encouraging team members to take time off

1. Lead by example. Take time off and be away from slack, When you come back, share photos and stories about what you did while you were away
1. Help team members prep to be away - create a template or game plan for your team to follow if they feel overwhelemd with tasks. Take time in slack or in a 1:1 to assess prioritities leading up to a longer time away to determine what should be the focus, what can wait, and what the rest of the team can take on
