Thanks for taking the time to read the first quarterly Mental Health newsletter from the GitLab Learning and Development team!

After hosting [Mental Health Awareness week](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/12/21/gitlab-mental-health-awareness-week-recap/) at the end of 2020, we heard from the GitLab team that a continued conversation about mental health would help provide resources, encourage conversation, and avoid burnout long-term.

To consistently support team members in addressing signs of burnout, we hope this newsletter will

1. Highlight resources you can access as a GitLab team member to support your mental health
1. Organize external resources we think you might find helpful
1. Encourage you to have conversations about mental health, taking time off, and managing burnout with your team and colleagues
1. Empower managers to support their team members 

## GitLab Resource Feature

[GitLab Paid Time Off Policy](/handbook/paid-time-off/)

Taking time off is important for managing burnout, and returning to work after a holiday or extended bread can feel overwhelming.

If you haven't recently reviewed our PTO policy, here are a few key points to review:

1. [A GitLab team member's guide to time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off)
1. [Communicating your time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off)
1. [Covid-19 medical leave policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/covid-19/#covid-19-medical-leave-policy)

It's important to remember that [rest and time off is productive](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#rest-and-time-off-are-productive). In December, we welcomed John Fitch, co-author of [Time Off](https://www.timeoffbook.com/), for a live speaker series discussing how time off can be used as a tool to manage burnout.

If you haven't watched the recording yet, take some time to do so:

During the interview, John touches on the following topics:

1. Examples of how taking time off can look and feel, and the positive impact this time has on our overall work performance mental health
1. How managers can support and lead team members to take time off
1. Strategies for returning from time off to make the most of the perspectives and time for reflection you've gained


## Taking time for mental health

The L&D team has transformed the content from our December 2020 Mental Health Awareness week into a self-paced learning path in our new learning experience platform, GitLab Learn. The pathway includes additions to resources that were built during the awareness week, handbook merge request that were contributed as a result of discussions during our live speaker series, and new recorded interviews with leadership.

This interview will also be featured in the self-paced mental health course in [GitLab Learn](course link)!


## Manager resources

People leaders can encourage and coach their team in taking time off to manage burnout. Here are a few strategies that manager can use to demonstrate why managing burnout is so important:

1. Lead by example. Take time off yourself, and when you're off, unplug from work
1. Use [PTO by Roots](/handbook/paid-time-off/#pto-by-roots) to communicate your time off
1. When you come back from time off, share photos and stories about what you did while you were away. Consider having a [social call](/handbook/communication/#social-call) with your team, or using a [Slack bot](/handbook/communication/#slackbots) like [GeekBot](https://geekbot.com/) to connect asynchronously. Not only can this time help demonstrate to your team the value of taking time off, but it can help build trust
1. Help your team prepare to take time off. Use time in a 1:1 or Slack conversation to assess priorities leading up to a long time away to determine what should be the focus, what can wait, and what the rest of the team can take on. This can help your team feel less overwhelmed as they prepare to take time off and help them feel confident in truly unplugging
1. Ask questions and take time to listen to stories about your team member's time off when they return
