Welcome to the GitLab Learning & Development (L&D) newsletter! The purpose of the L&D newsletter is to enable a culture of curiosity and continuous learning that *prioritizes learning* with a [growth mindset](/handbook/values/#growth-mindset) for team members. The quarterly newsletter will raise awareness of what learning initiatives took place in the past quarter, insight into what's coming next, learning tips, and encourage participation. We will also feature leadership and learner profiles that highlight what our community has done to learn new skills. Consider this a forum to hear from others across GitLab on what learning has done for them. 

You can find more information on the [structure and process](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/) for the L&D newsletter, as well as links to [past L&D Newsletters](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/#past-newsletters). 

## Learn from Leadership 

This month's Learn from Leadership looks a little different than [previous months](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/#past-newsletters). August 2021 is our [Career Development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) Skill of the Month, so each week we will be releasing videos from 2 team members at GitLab discussing Career Development. This week we are learning from Pattie Egan, Vice President, People Operations, Technology & Analytics, and Brendan O'Leary, Senior Develper Evangelist.
