## Taking time for mental health

2021-10-10 was World Mental Health day. Spring Health shared a one-page guide called [Supporting Mental Health in an Unequal World](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12tytq8qMp4TO4DovKTkrO4ZtNkfvDNbx/view?usp=sharing) that shares data about the inequeties of mental health and health care around the globe, and what you can do to help remove stigmas about mental health.

## Manager resources

You might have seen posts in the #whats-happening-at-gitlab in September from the L&D team about LinkedIn Wellness Week. These posts highlighted a few short LinkedIn Learning videos that might help break up your day and re-focus your attention on your work and your surroundings.

Managers can consider re-sharing theses short videos this week in their team Slack channels!
