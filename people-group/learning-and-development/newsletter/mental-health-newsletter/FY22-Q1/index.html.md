Thanks for tuning in to the 2nd edition of the GitLab Mental Health newsletter! If you're interested in learning more about the intentions behind this newsletter, check out our [goals](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/mental-health-newsletter/#long-term-goals) listed in the handbook.

## GitLab Resource Feature

If you haven't seen the update to the GitLab team member [modern health benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/modern-health/), check it out in the handbook. This quarter, [therapy sessions](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/modern-health/#care) have been added as a resource for team members, in addition to the existing coaching sessions. 

You can learn more about what Modern Health is all about in this [short interview with their CEO and founder](https://youtu.be/-oUb3RcQB3M), or sign up directly in the [Modern Health web platform or mobile app](https://www.joinmodernhealth.com/).

## Taking time for mental health

During the month of March, the Learning and Development team encouraged team members to check out the [Time Off pathway in GitLab Learn](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/time-off-is-productive-develop-your-rest-ethic). This pathway is featured on the [Mental Wellness channel](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/mental-wellness) and includes resources like:

1. A course by John Fitch called [Time Off: Design your Rest Ethic](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/time-off-is-productive-develop-your-rest-ethic/cards/1286463)
1. LinkedIn Learning courses on [Mindful Stress Management](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/time-off-is-productive-develop-your-rest-ethic/cards/1257710) and [How to create a life of meaning and purpose](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/time-off-is-productive-develop-your-rest-ethic/cards/1257713)
1. A call to action to contribute to our handbook section entitled [Your rest ethic is as important as your work ethic](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#your-rest-ethic-is-as-important-as-your-work-ethic)

Take some time this month to learn strategies about how you can better care for your mental health using these resources. Remember that team members can use the [Growth and Development benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-benefit) to expense courses like the Time Off: Design your Rest Ethic course linked above.
