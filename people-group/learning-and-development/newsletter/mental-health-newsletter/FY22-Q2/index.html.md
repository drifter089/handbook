## Mental Health Newsletter, Edition 3! 

Hellow, GitLab Team! Welcome to 3rd addition of the GitLab Mental Health newsletter! If you're interested in learning more about the intentions of this newsletter, check out our [goals](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/mental-health-newsletter/#long-term-goals) listed in the handbook.

And, if this is your first time reading the Mental health newsleeter, be sure to check out [past editions](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/mental-health-newsletter/#past-newsletters) for great information about what resources are available to prevent burnout and support your mental wellbeing as a team member.


## Leadership feature 

Did you know that L&D hosts a [CEO handbook learning session](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#ceo-handbook-learning-sessions) with Sid on a weekly basis? During these calls, we invite team members to join us for a small group conversation that dives deep into a specific topic in our leadership handbook, or topics that are relevant to team member success. 

During one of those sessions this quarter, the L&D team and other mental health advocates at GitLab talked to Sid about his experience with taking time off, managing burnout, and addressing imposter syndrome. Check out the meeting recording below or on the [mental health handbook page](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#introduction).

## GitLab Resource Feature


## Live Speaker Series about Rest Ethic

The L&D team was also happy to welcome John Fitch back to speak to GitLab for a second Live Speaker series! We first hosted John back in December 2020 where we discussed the importance of taking time off. 

During this second time around, John spoke to manager enablement of time off for their team and the ways that rest impacts both or productivity and engagement at work.

We were lucky to host John for 2 separate sessions, and you can find both recordings on the [mental health handbook page](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#your-rest-ethic-is-as-important-as-your-work-ethic). Here's the recording from our second session!
