## Mental Health Newsletter, Edition 3! 

Hello, GitLab Team! Welcome to 3rd edition of the GitLab Mental Health newsletter! If you're interested in learning more about the intentions of this newsletter, check out our [goals](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/mental-health-newsletter/#long-term-goals) listed in the handbook.

And, if this is your first time reading the Mental health newsletter, be sure to check out [past editions](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/mental-health-newsletter/#past-newsletters) for great information about team member resources to prevent burnout and support your mental wellbeing.


## Leadership feature 

Did you know that L&D hosts a [CEO handbook learning session](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#ceo-handbook-learning-sessions) with Sid on a weekly basis? During these calls, we invite team members to join us for a small-group conversation that dives deep into a specific topic in our leadership handbook, or topics that are relevant to team member success. 

During a recent session, the L&D team and other mental health advocates at GitLab talked to Sid about his experience with taking time off, managing burnout, and addressing imposter syndrome. Check out the meeting recording below or on the [mental health handbook page](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#introduction).

## Live Speaker Series about Rest Ethic

The L&D team was also happy to welcome John Fitch back to speak to GitLab for a second Live Speaker series! We [first hosted John back in December 2020](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#rest-and-time-off-are-productive) where we discussed the importance of taking time off. 

During this second time around, John spoke to manager enablement of time off for their team and the ways that rest impacts both or productivity and engagement at work.

We were lucky to host John for 2 separate sessions. You can find both recordings on the [mental health handbook page](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#your-rest-ethic-is-as-important-as-your-work-ethic). Here's the recording from our second session!

## Learning opportunities to improve team member wellbeing

Having [crucial conversations](/handbook/leadership/crucial-conversations/) both in and outside of work have a massive impact on our mental health. 

In May 2021, the University of Michigan hosted a crucial conversation about mental health where they discussed ["prioritizing mental health, educating and advocating for resources and policies, and creating an uplifting environment for everyone."](https://publicengagement.umich.edu/crucial-conversations-mental-health-awareness/)

Having open, safe conversations like this can be challenging and nerve wracking. Stigmas around mental health make it hard to bring up with our managers, colleages, friends, and family. Equipping yourself with tools and strategies to have effective and safe crucial conversations can improve the discussions we have at GitLab about mental health and team member wellbing.

The L&D team is certified to deliver the [Crucial Conversations](https://www.vitalsmarts.com/crucial-conversations-training/) training for interested team members. Read more about the program in this [crucial conversations blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/18/crucial-conversations/). If you're interested in the training, we encourage you to [fill out the interest form](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#crucial-conversations-training) to participate in the next internal training.
