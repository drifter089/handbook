* Which university/program were you a student in?
   * Kris: I completed the [Performance Leadership Certificate from Cornell University](https://www.ecornell.com/certificates/leadership-and-strategic-management/performance-leadership/).  
* What made you decide to do that program?
   * Kris: I chose this program because it aligned with skills I listed in my Individual Growth Plan. I really liked this program because it was flexible and you could choose different courses from the catalog to create a certificate that made sense for you.  You can check out the [courses I chose](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_nSe9FV7wTPtJMOXy_qPvLpITrf10P0LH1PQxnEQco/edit?usp=sharing).
* How will completing this program help you in your role at GitLab?
   * Kris: We don’t have enough time to talk about all of the benefits! At a high level, this program provided me a framework to help me organize my thoughts and to lead learning initiatives and a high performing team to tackle the enablement challenges that come our way! 
* What is one thing you have learned so far in your program that has been beneficial?
   * Kris: The Change Management course was something that I was able to lean into right away. So many of our learning programs require some behavioral change and thinking through a change management plan from the beginning helps the field understand why we are doing this and why we are doing this right now! 
* When will your program be completed?
   * Kris: I completed the program in July of this year, and it took about 12 weeks.
* What advice would you give someone who is thinking about participating in GitLab's tuition reimbursement program?
   * Kris: GitLab offers [$20K for your education](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#tuition-reimbursement), and it’s like free money! More people should take advantage of the program. It worked with my manager and the process was pretty easy. 
* Anything else you would like to share on the tuition reimbursement program?
   * Kris: There are so many amazing programs out there! Take a look and talk to your manager today, why wait? Everyday is a great day for learning. I understand everyone is busy, but it really is worth the time investment in yourself.

## Learning Tips 

We want to remind you to [take time out to learn](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign)! Focus Friday's are a great time to focus on learning. 

Are you having a hard time finding or making time for learning? The Potentiality outlines [seven ways to make time for learning](https://thepotentiality.com/seven-ways-to-make-time-for-learning/). 

### Seven Ways to Make Time for Learning

- **Find motivation** - Start making time for learning by beginning with a topic – any topic – that “lights you up” and ignites your purpose.
- **Start small** - Maybe you can’t imagine fitting a Masters program into your life right now, but you can imagine reading a book or some articles about co-operatives and exploring a few relevant massive open online courses (MOOCS) about leading social impact.
- **Create buy-in** - HBR’s Rachael O’Meara recommends that you create a vision statement that can answer this question: “who will I become as a result of this investment of my time and resources?” 
- **Make time** - Time blocks, argues Fast Company’s Gwen Moran, are more effective than to-do lists because they force you to put what needs to be done in the proper place for the right amount of time.
- **Find space** - Changing your environment can shift your perspective and open your mind to formal and informal learning. 
- **Be disciplined** - Most employees don’t follow through with learning experiences because they aren’t fun, aren’t relevant and no one is holding them accountable to finish. You will require unbreakable self-discipline (or something approaching it) to follow-through with your commitment to learning
- **Share the value** - An easy way to do this is through journaling about what you learned from the experience.
