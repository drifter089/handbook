title: FY22-Q2 Learning & Development Newsletter
---

Welcome to the GitLab Learning & Development (L&D) newsletter! The purpose of the L&D newsletter is to enable a culture of curiosity and continuous learning that *prioritizes learning* with a [growth mindset](/handbook/values/#growth-mindset) for team members. The quarterly newsletter will raise awareness of what learning initiatives took place in the past quarter, insight into what's coming next, learning tips, and encourage participation. We will also feature leadership and learner profiles that highlight what our community has done to learn new skills. Consider this a forum to hear from others across GitLab on what learning has done for them. 

You can find more information on the [structure and process](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/) for the L&D newsletter, as well as links to [past L&D Newsletters](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/#past-newsletters).

We want to remind you to [take time out to learn](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign)! [Focus Fridays](/handbook/communication/#focus-fridays) have been extended to 2021-04-30 and are a great time to focus on learning. Consider blocking off a few hours each week on Fridays to learn new skills for your role at GitLab. 

There are plenty of courses on GitLab Learn as well as LinkedIn Learning that you can access. Check out our [recommended LinkedIn Learning courses](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/linkedin-learning/)! If you find a course that you think should be on the recommendation list, make an MR to the list and ask a L&D Team member in the `#learninganddevelopment` Slack Channel to merge.
