## Overview

Welcome to the Learning & Development (L&D) Newsletter page! The L&D Team is launching a quarterly newsletter in FY21-Q4 that recaps important learning related information from the previous quarter and highlights important information for the upcoming quarter. The main goal of this communication is to **help team members prioritize learning** and have a [growth mindset](/handbook/values/#growth-mindset). 

## Target Audience

This newsletter has content that is relevant for all GitLab team members. 

## Past Newsletters

| **Edition** | **Date Released** | **Highlights** |

| [FY22-Q1](link) | TBA | TBA |


## Newsletter Process 

The newsletter is live **on the first Wednesday of each Quarter.**  

We build the newsletter in an issue in the [Learning & Development project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-and-development). The process for the issue includes: 
- The issue for the upcoming newsletter is opened at least three weeks before the publish date. 
- Relevant stakeholders/contributors are tagged in the issue each month to provide content or review suggested content in the outline. 
- Once the outline is complete, L&D team drafts the newsletter in a WIP MR. 
- Reviewers provide feedback no later than 3 pm CT two business days before the planned go-live date to allow time for revisions.
- L&D Team announces the newsletter via slack on go live date. 
- Once the newsletter goes live, the L&D Team sends a slack notification in the #whats-happening-at-gitlab, #learninganddevelopment, and #managers Slack channels 
- Once the newsletter is live, the L&D team closes out the planning issue.  

### Template

The following template is the typical template for each newsletter. When creating the newsletter, the template can be copied, pasted, and then filled in accordingly.
