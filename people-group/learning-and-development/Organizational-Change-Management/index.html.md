## Introduction 

GitLab is growing fast and we have been ranked as one of the [fastest-growing private software companies](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/08/16/gitlab-ranked-44-on-inc-5000-list/). Headcount has nearly doubled in the last year and we have plans to [continue to grow](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/). As we scale, there will be more and more changes to how we operate as an organization. New technology will be introduced to make us more efficient, new processes will be introduced to improve transparency, functional groups will be redesigned and adjusted to meet our growing headcount and strategic objectives, job families will change and policies in the handbook will be altered that have a big impact on how we operate. 

As we evolve, there is a need to implement a organizational change management (OCM) process and methodology to ensure impacted team members receive the awareness, leadership, coaching, and training they need to change successfully. This handbook page will walk through a step-by-step approach to OCM at GitLab. People leaders and individual contributors can use this page when organizing an organizational change management process and campaign. 

## What is Organizational Change Management (OCM)

OCM refers to the actions in which a company or business alters a major component of its organization, such as its culture, technology, people, process, or policies it uses to operate. OCM is the method of leveraging change to bring about a successful resolution, and it typically includes a systematic methodology to support a transformational journey. 

## When to use OCM at GitLab

At GitLab, there are many use cases for applying an OCM process. Some examples include: 
- Adoption of a new technology that all team members will use (i.e. Integrating the Learning Management System, etc.) 
- Implementing a new succession planning process (i.e. Nine box assessment) 
- Rolling out a 360 review process for all team members to use
- Updating our total rewards policies (i.e. country conversation, compensation, etc.) 
- Announcing and implementing a company-wide initiative (i.e. Direct messages in slack, internal comms campaign, etc.) 
- Changing a hot button policy (i.e. discretionary bonus criteria requiring additional requirements) 
- Implementing a new system or tool for all team members that some may see as contentious (i.e. Endpoint Management software,etc.) 
- Communication of a Handbook update that will change the way team members conduct their day-to-day duties (i.e. new processes or policies, etc.)
- Providing awareness and generating excitement for a company-wide initiative (i.e. friends and family day, etc.) 
- Enabling team members to effectively use new tools to improve their job at the time of release (i.e. Culture AMP, Learning Management System, etc.) 

There are varying levels of the OCM process that can be implemented to facilitate the change. The above is a small example of the type of organization-wide initiatives that we can consider applying the OCM methodology. Keep in mind that some transformations require less OCM, while major changes require a heavy focus on OCM. Consider if they change will impact the whole organization. If it will, apply the OCM methodology. 

## Why is OCM important

Organizational change is necessary for GitLab to succeed and grow. OCM drives the successful adoption and usage of change within the business. It allows team members to understand and commit to the shift and work effectively during it. Without effective OCM, GitLab transitions can be rocky and expensive in terms of both time and resources. Ultimately, a lack of OCM can lead to important initiatives to not take off or fail after the introduction. 

## GitLab OCM methodology

We are going to define an OCM process that aligns with our values, organizational structure, and ways of working. Key components of GitLab’s OCM methodology: 
1. Develop an agile change plan
2. Assess the impact
3. Analyze team member engagement
4. Communicate the change
5. Train for the change
6. Measure and adopt the change

### Step 1 - Develop an agile change plan

When rolling out an organization-wide change that will impact all team members, the first step is to develop an agile change plan. An agile change plan can be informal and the DRI for the change can do it asynchronously with others leading the change. You can draft the plan in a google doc and use it as a starting point when planning for change. For OCM to work, it’s essential to have all the components documented as a source of record and plan for the change. 

When developing the agile change plan, there are a few important components to consider: 
1. **Leadership Engagement:** Visible leadership is the key to success on any large scale transformations at GitLab. Team members will be looking to leaders for cues on how to interpret the change and what actions to take. Depending on the scale of the change, its success will depend on leaders effectively sponsoring and ensuring readiness within their functional groups. 
    - Leadership will drive team member engagement and adoption of the change
2. **Leadership awareness and engagement plan:** As you start to develop an understanding of how to drive team member engagement with leaders, consider plotting out awareness activities you will do with leaders to get them bought in on the change. Communicate what you will do and why you need their support to drive adoption.
3. **Include all other components** of the GitLab OCM methodology to your change plan:
   - Impact assessment
   - Team member engagement analysis
   - Communication plan
   - Training plan
   - Measurement and adoption

### Step 2 - Assess the impact

Before rolling out the change, consider measuring the impact. Depending on the severity, it is important to understand the current state before communicating the future state. Document the impacts in your agile change plan. It’s important to consider all of the potential impacts to mitigate disruptions to team member’s day-to-day work. Some key questions to answer when assessing the impact of the change: 

- What’s the history behind this transformation?
- Has GitLab tried to do this before?
- Were previous changes successful? If not, why weren’t they? 
- Have similar changes been well received? 
- What is the current process outlined in the Handbook? 
- How will the new change impact team members' ways of working?
- Other impacts to consider

### Step 3 - Analyze team member engagement 

With any major change, it is essential to identify which groups within the organization that will be impacted. In this step, we can determine who will be impacted and identify mitigation strategies to ensure minimal disruption to their day-to-day work. 

After you have completed the impact assessment, you can determine which groups of people in the organization will be impacted the most by the change. For example, 360 reviews will require significant manager time and dedication. Managers are the most impacted by the reviews, especially if they have a high number of direct reports. When rolling out the 360 reviews, managers should be the target audience to cascade information down to their teams. 

When rolling out a new initiative, consider who in the organization will be the most impacted. 

### Step 4 - Communicating the change

Once you’ve understood the impacts and who will be most impacted, start developing a communication plan. Analyzing team member engagement and impacts can help guide and engage team members through the change program. Communications can be updated per feedback from impacted groups. 

Focus on delivering the right amount of detail to the right audience, through the right communications channel, and at the right time. We typically rely on slack channels to send organization-wide communications. Leverage the channels that will provide the most impact to ensure leaders and team members can articulate with clarity and purpose of the change project. 

The goal of this step is to build the credibility of the project and what it will deliver. It can also help generate a positive perception of the transformation. 

**Key Activities:**
- Communication plan: identify what, when, and to whom
- Key messages
- Communication materials: Slack messages outline, handbook page links, templates, videos, etc. 

### Step 5 - Train for the change

Training for the change should include both traditional and informal methods to address the needs of varied audiences. Relevant content can be developed to support team members who will be most impacted and the specific project requirements. Training materials can include slide decks, handbook pages, explainer videos, job-aides, tutorials, etc. Training can also be delivered through [live learning](https://gitlab.zoom.us/j/6941107756?pwd=ZFJHT0lDSFhRYStZd2VKWEdNQ3hqQT09 Hide) and recordings that walk team members through the transformation. 

Research shows that a blend of the types of training below is the most effective to achieve successful knowledge retention and skill internalization. Per the GitLab 70-20-10 training approach, the majority of the training will focus on where 70% of learning occurs - learning all the time resources, 20% occurs when learning from others, and 10% via traditional instruction. Consider holding a traditional/formal training event for the type of transformation that is taking place.

### Step 6 - Measure and adopt the change

The ultimate purpose of the OCM process is to get team members to adopt the change and implement it in their day-to-day role. To ensure this, it is important to focus on user adoption and measure it regularly so we can adjust the communications and training approach. [Apply iteration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/iteration/) to the change by consistently looking for new ways to roll out programs more [efficiently](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/iteration/).  

To drive the adoption and usage of new changes, it is essential to provide proper metrics and measurement tools. A successful adoption helps in mitigating the organizational challenges and realizing business benefits to ensure better ROI and a successful sustained transformation. 

## A Manager's role in OCM

Within GitLab, every team member has a different role in assisting with change. Leaders, for example, have to be courageous by taking on risks. They can look at the big picture and articulate high-level changes to the organization, explain why it is occurring, and motivate team members to support the transition. 

Managers can be more concentrated on making business transitions successful. They focus on implementing change by determining the discrete steps that need to happen and their sequence. It is the primary responsibility of a manager to know how to design, direct, and shape change processes while advocating for its support. By learning how to preempt and address the challenges associated with change, managers can ensure they are equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to manage it. 

## Preparing for OCM at GitLab

To prepare for GitLab transformations/changes, first, define the goal of the organizational change, understand why it is critical, and garner support from team members. Then, use the OCM methodology laid out on the page to begin designing and delivering the OCM process. Ensure the methodology aligns with the goals. Note what challenges may arise and be flexible enough to adjust accordingly. Be sure to celebrate small victories along the way!

OCM doesn’t stop once you’ve successfully executed the transition. Both throughout and following the OCM process, you need to continuously assess outcomes, measure data, train employees on new methodologies and business practices, and readjust goals as necessary to increase adoption.
