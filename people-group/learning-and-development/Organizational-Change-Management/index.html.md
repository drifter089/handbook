## Introduction 

GitLab is growing fast and we have been ranked as one of the fastest-growing private software companies. Headcount has nearly doubled in the last year and we have plans to continue to grow. As we scale, there will be more and more changes to how we operate as an organization. New technology will be introduced to make us more efficient; new processes will be introduced to improve transparency; functional groups will be redesigned and adjusted to meet our growing headcount and strategic objectives; job families will change and policies in the handbook will be altered that have a big impact on how we operate at GitLab. 

As we evolve, there is a need to implement an organizational change management (OCM) process and methodology to ensure impacted team members receive the awareness, leadership, coaching, and training they need to change successfully. This handbook page will walk through a step-by-step approach to organizational change management at GitLab. Weâ€™ve also provided a playbook for all people leaders and individual contributors to use when organizing an organizational change management process.
