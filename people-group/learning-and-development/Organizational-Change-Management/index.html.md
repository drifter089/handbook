## Introduction 

GitLab is growing fast and we have been ranked as one of the [fastest-growing private software companies](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/08/16/gitlab-ranked-44-on-inc-5000-list/). Headcount has nearly doubled in the last year and we have plans to [continue to grow](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/). As we scale, there will be more and more changes to how we operate as an organization. New technology will be introduced to make us more efficient; new processes will be introduced to improve transparency; functional groups will be redesigned and adjusted to meet our growing headcount and strategic objectives; job families will change and policies in the handbook will be altered that have a big impact on how we operate at GitLab. 

As we evolve, there is a need to implement an organizational change management (OCM) process and methodology to ensure impacted team members receive the awareness, leadership, coaching, and training they need to change successfully. This handbook page will walk through a step-by-step approach to organizational change management at GitLab. We’ve also provided a playbook for all people leaders and individual contributors to use when organizing an organizational change management process. 

## What is Organizational Change Management (OCM)

OCM refers to the actions in which a company or business alters a major component of its organization, such as its culture, technology, people, process, or policies it uses to operate. OCM is the method of leveraging change to bring about a successful resolution, and it typically includes a systematic methodology to support a transformational journey. 

## When to use OCM at GitLab

At GitLab, there are many use cases for applying an OCM process. Some examples include: 
- Adoption of a new technology that all team members will use (i.e. Integrating the Learning Management System) 
- Implementing a new succession planning process (i.e. Nine box assessment) 
- Rolling out a 360 review process for all team members to implement
- Updating our total rewards policies (i.e. country conversation, compensation, etc) 
- Announcing and implementing a company-wide initiative (i.e. Slack usage internal comms campaign) 
- Changing a hot button policy (i.e. discretionary bonus criteria requiring additional requirements) 
- Implementing a new system or tool for all team members that some may see as contentious (i.e. Endpoint Management software) 
- Communication of a Handbook update that will change the way team members conduct their day-to-day duties 
- Providing awareness and generating excitement for a company-wide initiative (i.e. friends and family day) 
- Enabling team members to effectively use new tools to improve their job at the time of release (i.e. Learning Management System) 

There are varying levels of the OCM process that can be implemented to facilitate the change. The above is a small example of the type of organization-wide initiatives that should consider applying the OCM methodology. Keep in mind that some transformations require less OCM, while major changes require a heavy focus on OCM. 

## Why is OCM Important

Organizational change is necessary for GitLab to succeed and grow. OCM drives the successful adoption and usage of change within the business. It allows team members to understand and commit to the shift and work effectively during it. Without effective OCM, GitLab transitions and be rocky and expensive in terms of both time and resources. Ultimately, a lack of OCM can lead important initiatives to not take off or fail. 

## GitLab OCM methodology

We are going to define an OCM process that aligns with our values, organizational structure, and ways of working. Key components of GitLab’s OCM methodology:
