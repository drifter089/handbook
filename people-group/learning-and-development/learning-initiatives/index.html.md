## Learning Initiatives Introduction

The Learning & Development team is rolling out learning programs to enable a [culture of curiosity and continual learning](/handbook/values/#growth-mindset). The learning initiatives are intended to provide a forum for team members to come together to learn about all of the activities taking place in the learning space, as well as hear from leaders internally and externally on various leadership topics. 


## Monthly Continuous Learning Call Overview

At GitLab, the Learning and Development (L&D) team hosts a monthly Monthly Continuous Learning call. The series is intended to showcase all of the L&D initatives taking place at GitLab as well as provide a space for team members to ask questions. It's an opportunity to come together as an organization and highlight everything we are doing within the L&D space and to help instill a learning culture at GitLab. 

### Goals
1. Spur a culture of curiosity and continuous learning by highlighting all the initiatives we have taking place in learning & development.
1. Increase engagement and improve team member satisfaction and productivity by advancing understanding of available L&D resources

Additional background information on this initiaitve is available in the [Monthly Continuous Learning Call issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/96)

### Hosting a Monthly Continuous Learning Call

The following process outlines steps for the L&D team to take each month when planning and implementing monthly calls.

**Planning Issue Template:** Open an Monthly Continuous Learning Call issue template in the L&D Project. Steps outlined below are also included in the issue template and are included here as reference.

1. Post in the [#peopleops Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C0SNC8F2N/thread/C0SNC8F2N-1602618225.269200) to coordinate a Zoom meeting on the company calendar. This meeting should be set up to live stream to the GitLab unfiltered YouTube channel. Consider hosting the call at least 2 times to best accommodate for multiple time zones.
1. Create slide deck for presentation. Make a copy of a previous month's presention in the [Continuous Learning Campaign Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d4ksJXBMrATATxN0QyJ4FA6hzchMNdvb?usp=sharing)
1. Coordinate slide deck with appropriate enablement audiences (i.e DIB, Field Enablement, Professional Services, Marketing Enablement, etc)
1. Update slide deck for presentation with feedback from coordinated audiences
1. Open a feedback issue for questions and comments to be shared asynchronously.
1. Coordinate an announcement of the call in the #company-fyi Slack channel from Sid or another executive/manager who will be featured that month. The post should be shared 1 business day before the call. This post should include a link to the slide deck and coresponding issue. See notes below for a template that can be shared.

## Learning Speaker Series Overview

The L&D team hosts a monthly Learning Speaker Series call, open to all team members. The calls serve to provide a space where senior executives and mid-level people leaders can share relevant topics to engage and teach team members lessons learned from their own careers and answer relevant L&D related questions. We also hope to use this forum for external speakers to teach topics on relevant skills for team members. 

### Goals 
1. Provide a forum where team members can hear from established leaders on how they've managed their career and lessons learned to share with the wider community. 

### Examples of Call Topics

This list of topics can be used as a starting point for brainstorming content and connecting with individuals to feature during Learning Speaker Series calls. This is not an exhasutive list - please add new ideas to this list as they come up in each monthly call!

- L&D Initiatives 
- Leading Teams
- Managing Remote Teams
- Managing Underperformance
- Crucial Conversations
- Coaching
- Leadership Best Practices
- Developing Emotional Intelligence
- Developing High Performing Teams
- Managing Conflict

### Hosting a Learning Speaker Series call

The following process outlines steps for the L&D team to take when planning and implementing the calls. 

Anyone or any team can host a Learning Speaker Series for the organization! If interested and there is a topic & speaker lined up,  please fill out a [Learning & Development Request template](/people-group/learning-development/general/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/learning-and-development-request.md) to begin the process. 

**Planning Issue Template:** Open a `learning-speaker-series` issue template in the L&D [General Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/tree/master). Steps outlined below are also included in the issue template and are included here as reference.

1. Collaborate with exec team, mid-level people leaders, and other interested GitLab Team members to gauge interest and availability to be featured in the call. Be mindful to include diverse voices from across the GitLab team.
1. Determine if this is an internal or external speaker for the series call. If external speaker, ensure that the speaker has been validated and that the topic covered aligns with our values. External speaker presentations need to aling with how we deliver group conversations. 
1. Post in the [#peopleops Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C0SNC8F2N/thread/C0SNC8F2N-1602618225.269200) to coordinate a Zoom meeting on the company calendar. This meeting should be set up to live stream to the GitLab unfiltered YouTube channel. Consider hosting the call at least 2 times to best accommodate for multiple time zones.
1. Test Zoom functionality with the speaker at least two business days before event. 
   * If external speaker, ensure they have downloaded [Zoom](https://zoom.us/support/download). 
   * Have speaker test [audio and video](/handbook/tools-and-tips/zoom/#how-to-test-audio-and-video-in-zoom). 
   * Check that speaker will be able to [share a presentation](/handbook/tools-and-tips/zoom/#how-to-share-a-presentation-in-zoom) if necessary. 
1. Send speaker calendar invite with all details for the call (including, but not limited to, Zoom link, agenda, slides, etc.). 
1. Create slide deck for presentation. Make a copy of a previous month's presention in the [Continuous Learning Campaign Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d4ksJXBMrATATxN0QyJ4FA6hzchMNdvb?usp=sharing)
1. Open a feedback issue for questions and comments to be shared asynchronously.
1. Coordinate an announcement of the call in the #company-fyi Slack channel from Sid or another executive/manager who will be featured that month. The post should be shared 1 business day before the call. This post should include a link to the slide deck and coresponding issue. See notes below for a template that can be shared.

## Learning & Development Quarterly Newsletter

The L&D team also hosts and develops a [quarterly newsletter](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/) for the community. 


## Take Time Out To Learn Campaign

Focus Friday's are a great benefit at GitLab. We try to schedule minimal meetings on Fridays to catch up on work and grow our skills professionally. Use Focus Fridays to take time out to learn. Team members can work with their manager through a [career development conversation](/handbook/leadership/1-1/#career-development-discussion-at-the-1-1) to determine what skills that want to grow in the future. Aspirations can be documented in a [individual growth plan](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internal-resources). From there, identify what will be needed to attain the new skills and consider using [tuition reimbursement](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#tuition-reimbursement) or [expensing professional development courses](/handbook/finance/expenses/#work-related-online-courses-and-professional-development-certifications) up to $500 USD per fiscal year. Block time off your calendar every week or month to devote to learning new skills. Share what you are learning with team members and in the #learninganddevelopment slack channel. 


## Mini-Challenge

Mini-challenges are 1 week learning opportunities that utilitze a combination of GitLab issues, live learning sessions, and Slack to organize a group of learners around a specific topic. Mini-challenges are advertised to team members via slack and require interested learners to opt in. Participation in issue discussion questions and in live learning sessions (synchronous and asynchronous) are is tracked by the L&D team or challenge organizer. Upon completion of the challenge, participants are awareded a certification. The L&D team has used the mini-challenge model to engage learners on topics like psychological safety.

In addition to the use of GitLab, each mini-challenge includes a dedicated Slack channel to organize conversation, share new issue links, and provide space for team members to ask questions. 

Examples of current and past challanges can be found in the [Learning and Development project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/challenges)


## Internal Learning Campaigns

Learning campaigns at GitLab have an asynchronous focus and are used to raise awareness around a specific topic or set of resources. These campaigns are inspired by the structure of a learning challenge but without the required engagement or tracking. For example, the L&D team is using a learning campaign structure to host a [mental health awareness week](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/156)

Learning campaigns use a combination of GitLab issues and Slack announcements to raise awareness and spark discussion. Following the campaign, the L&D team will aggregate comments and resources that have surfaced and document in the handbook. Learning campaigns can be used to build buzz around a live speaker series or to start conversation about a common question or issue that GitLab team members are facing.
