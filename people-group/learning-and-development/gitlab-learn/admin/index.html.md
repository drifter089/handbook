## Navigating GitLab Learn Admin Content

On this page, team members working in the GitLab Learn platform and GitLab Learning Evangelists will find documented processes and best practices for content creation. The page is split into two important sections.

| Section Number | Title | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| 1 | [Best practices for content creation and organization](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/#best-practices-for-content-creation-and-organization) | This section will outline best practices for creating on brand, handbook first learning content in GitLab learn. Please get familiar with this section before creating or organizing content in GitLab Learn. |
| 2 | [Processes, management, and maintenance of content in EdCast](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/#processes-management-and-maintence-of-content-in-edcast)) | This section outlines written and demonstrated processes in the frontend and backend of GitLab Learn that are used to create, edit, and maintain content |
| 3 | [Reporting](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/#approvals) | TBD|


## Best practices for content creation and organization

These best practices are iterative and will continuously update. As the LXP implementation team discovers new ways to utilize EdCast, these best practices will be updated. EdCast admins and team members should consider opening an MR to this page and adding best practices as they discover new use cases and tools in the platform for content creation and curation. 

If EdCast admins have questions about best practices in the LXP or need support in making decisions about how to upload and organize their content, please reach out to the [L&D team in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CMRAWQ97W/thread/CAEEVBR2M-1608029461.344100).

If you're just getting started using EdCast, watch this short overview of the user experience in the platform and how new learning content fits into this design.

### Contributing learning content

Definitions and examples of SmartCards, Journeys, Pathways, Channels, Carousels, Channels, and Groups can be found in our [GitLab Learn contribution docs](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/contribute/#learning-content-in-the-lxp)

Before reviewing the documented best practices below, take time to watch these recorded video examples of how content is contributed to GitLab Learn. These demos will help familiarize you with the terminology and structure of content in the platform and give context to the documented best practices.


#### Examples: Contributing content to GitLab Learn


##### Contribute an interesting article or video

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cvYt5o3sWk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


##### Contribute a new Pathway or Journey

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cuhI8Plcrbo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Content creation best practices

#### Applicable to all content

1. URLs for content cannot be deleted or edited, and they are generated automatically by the title that is first entered for the content. This is the same for all content in the platform, so take care to properly name content when you're creating it for the first time. When content is deleted, that URL can no longer be used.

#### SmartCards

1. SmartCards created in a Pathway or Journey are only discoverable from within that pathway or Journey. Create SmartCards with quizzes, polls, or other action items from learners from within the Journey or Pathway
1. Create content based SmartCards independently from a Journey or Pathway so that content can be repurposed and discovered
1. Always set an estimated time to finish for each SmartCard, as this is used to give an accurate guess on how long the content will take to consume

#### Pathways

1. Badges can be awarded upon completion of a Pathway. If the Pathway is not part of a Journey, use the Pathway level badges
1. Enable lock functions for pathways where you want learners to go through the content in a specific order. For locked pathways, leave the first SmartCard unlocked, and lock all subsequent Smartcards.
1. End Pathways that earn a badge with the sharing a [GitLab Learn badge SmartCard](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/gitlab-certification/cards/1045949)
1. Consider ending Pathways with a SmartCard that provides next steps for learning. This could be a call to action to take a similar Pathway or follow a Channel.
1. Enable leap functions for pathways where you want to redirect the learner based on how they perform on a quiz. For example, if a user passes a quiz, they can leap to the next SmartCard, but if they fail, they can be directed back to a SmartCard to review content before taking the quiz again.

Here is an example where you might use lock and leap in a Pathway:

In the GitLab 101 certification, a user must first read the handbook page on technical terminology, then take the knowledge assessment. If the user passes the quiz, they will leap to the next SmartCard, which brings them to the next handbook section. If the user fails, they will leap back to the initial SmartCard to review the quiz content. In the same pathway, we have a short poll used as a knowledge check. In this case, if the user answers either correctly or incorrectly, they move forward through the locked SmartCards as normal without any using leap functionality.

Watch this video example that explains the use of lock and leap in a Pathway:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQRhuGK8QVs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Journeys

1. Badges can be awarded upon the completion of a Journey. It's best to require all pathways be completed in order to earn a badge and use a Journey level badge over Pathway level badges
1. End Journeys that earn a badge with the sharing a [GitLab Learn badge SmartCard](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/gitlab-certification/cards/1045949)
1. Consider ending Pathways with a SmartCard that provides next steps for learning. This could be a call to action to take a similar Pathway or follow a Channel.


### Order of Operations for Content Creation

#### Step 1: Determine if content is `public` or `private`

| Content Type | Definition | Example Audience |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `private` | Content is only visible to the assigned learner or assigned group | Content for the GitLab team or customers only |
| `public` | Content is discoverable and visible to all learners in the platform | Content for wider community members |

Watch this video that explains the difference between public and private content in GitLab Learn:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDu7CbyNHj8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Step 2: Build smartcards depending on content status 

This video outlines the three scenarios for building public versus private content outlined below:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__6zr0C3Dmk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

##### Building `public` content

1. Build SmartCards independently of any Pathways or Journey
1. Make sure the `private` content checkbox is unchecked for SmartCards, Pathways, and Journeys
1. Add SmartCards to relevant Pathways, Journeys, Channels, and Groups

**Example:** L&D creates a publicly available course called GitLab 101. The SmartCards for this course link to the handbook and should be public to all users in the platform. The team will create each SmartCard independently in the EdCast platform, then add them all to a Pathway. Quizzes for the course will be created within the Pathway to utilize progressive unlocking features. The course can be broadcasted on public channels for new learners to discover the content.

##### Building `private` content 

1. Build Smartcards within a Pathway or Journey
1. Make sure the `private` content checkbox is checked for SmartCards, Pathways, and Journeys
1. Assign content directly to an individual user or group

**Example:** L&D uploads a compliance course with graded content for a specific group of learners. Since it is graded, interactive content, we want this path to only be assigned to the GitLab team. SmartCards will be built within a private Pathway that will be assigned directly to team members via a Group. In the future, the team might create a public course without the graded elements that could be public for the wider community.

##### Building content with both `public` and `private` elements

Option 3: If parts of the content are for a certain audience and parts are available to all learners

1. Create a Pathway and confirm the `private` content checkbox is checked
1. Create `private` content in SmartCards in a Pathway
1. Create `public` content in a SmartCard outside of the private Pathway
1. Assign Pathway to specific learners or groups

**Example:** L&D hosts a [manager challenge course](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-challenge/) with graded content for a specific group of learners. The team wants the manager content available for the wider community but needs the graded content to be restricted to assigned learners. SmartCards with public content will be built independently of any Pathway, then added to the private manager challenge Pathway. SmartCards with private content will be built within the private manager challenge Pathway. This private Pathway will be assigned to specific audiences and the wider community can discover content in SmartCards.

There is also the option to organize these public SmartCards into a second Pathway that the wider community can access without the graded requirements. Perhaps a quick quiz or poll could be utilized here instead. 

### Choosing between a badge or certification

#### Badges

Badges are available with the creation of both pathways and journeys and are awarded to the learner on the EdCast platform upon completing a set Pathway or Journey. Badges can also be [shared by the learner](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/user/#sharing-your-gitlab-learn-badges) on their LinkedIn profiles.

Teams should choose to use a badge to recognize learners achievements when:

- Learning Pathways are completed
- Journeys that do not require an official certification or accreditation 
- Setting goals, motivating behaviors, representing achievements, and communicating success

Follow the steps below for [creating a badge in EdCast](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/#creating-a-badge)

Watch this video to review how to add badges to a Pathway or Journey:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnBSYZ8Cbws" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#### Certification

Certifications are available for content updated in the Leapest LMS Lite with the combination of assessments created in Mettl. The certifications can be shared externally.

Teams should choose to use certifications to recognize learners achievements when:

- Learners require an official certification upon completion
- Establishing credibility in a specific skill area, etc.


### Image guidelines

Images in the LXP enable us to: 

- maintain a look and feel that aligns with the GitLab brand
- help users identify different kinds of content in the platform

The following outlines best practices for choosing images to use in the LXP. When content is created in the LXP in any form, an image or placeholder is automatically generated. Follow these best practices to update these placeholder images before publishing new content.

#### Choosing photographs

The GitLab team will use the following photographers on [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) for images in the LXP.

- [LinkedIn Sales Navigator](https://unsplash.com/@linkedinsalesnavigator)
- [WOCintech](https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat)

Future photographers will be added as needed.

If you're looking for pre-approved images for your content, please review the [GitLab Learn photo drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GvE-MUtHzGbZ9KX-16bsTvwFDn-Cd4hy?ths=true).

Keep the following in mind when choosing a photograph:

1. Look for opportunities to demonstrate [GitLab culture](/company/culture/). For example, consider choosing an image of a learner working on their laptop to reflect [all-remote work](/company/culture/all-remote/), two people working together to demonstrate [collaboration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration), or a family or small group of friends learning together to reflect [friends and family first, work second](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second)
1. Choose inclusive images that reflect our values of [Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging](/company/culture/inclusion/)
1. Look for opportunities to use images that demonstrate learning. This could include virtual classroom discussion, social learning/networking, working on a project, use of mobile, leadership talks, etc. 
1. Avoid images of large groups as it could make content look out of date
1. Keep the focal point of the image in the middle to enable better cropping and addition of the image overlays described below


#### Images for Journeys and Pathways

Journeys and Pathways will be identified with a white graphic image overlay and the GitLab logo using either black or white text. Here's an example:

![journey-pathway-image](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/journey-pathway.jpg)

[Example of images in Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEQ-5KGqe4/7JF_Fz8qV2a0owZDQGLlcw/view?utm_content=DAEQ-5KGqe4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)

We've organized a [GitLab Learn photo drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GvE-MUtHzGbZ9KX-16bsTvwFDn-Cd4hy?ths=true) so that contributors to GitLab Learn can access pre-edited photos to upload.

#### Images for SmartCards

Use the following chart to determine what image is best to use for your SmartCard content

| Scenario | Image Guidelines |
| ----- | ----- |
| The SmartCard will be broadcasted on the Discover page | Follow guidelines for Journey and Pathway images |
| The SmartCard links to the Handbook | Use the auto-generated GitLab logo |
| The SmartCard is stored within a Pathway or Journey | You may either update each image following the guidelines for Journey and Pathway images or use the auto-generated images in the platform |

#### Images for Channels

Channels will be identified with a branded banner image with a custom Tanuki in the center. Here's an example:

![channel-image](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/channel.jpg)

This [basic Channel image in Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEQ_HWFcFs/238nynM1dCJOSWUrrecCqA/view?utm_content=DAEQ_HWFcFs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink) can be used for any Channel in the platform.

The LXP implementation team will collaborate with the brand team to customize the Channel images to fit specific content when necessary.

You can find pre-approved Channel images in the [GitLab Learn photo drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GvE-MUtHzGbZ9KX-16bsTvwFDn-Cd4hy?ths=true)

#### Images for Groups

Groups will be identified with images that use a purple graphic overlay on the left side of the image, with the GitLab logo and white text. Here's an example of multiple Groups displayed on the Discover page:

![groups-image](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/groups.jpg)

[Example of images in Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEQ-q4s2pY/soqq_hq3ND1oUNh7x6KPHA/view?utm_content=DAEQ-q4s2pY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)

You can find pre-approved Group images in the [GitLab Learn photo drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GvE-MUtHzGbZ9KX-16bsTvwFDn-Cd4hy?ths=true)

#### Profile photos

Individual learners are responsible for uploading their own profile and banner photos.


### Peer review content before publishing

It's important to have another member of your team review your content before making it live on the platform. Consider using this process to review content in the LXP. If your team decides on a different peer-review process, please document on this page.

#### Prior to peer review

1. The content creator or curator builds the content in the LXP, including opening SmartCards, branded images, and organizing Pathways and Journeys
1. Mark content to `save for later`, which leaves it in a draft state (not yet published)
1. Team collaborates in Slack to find a reviewer for their private content by sharing the direct link to EdCast
1. Reviewer uses the following checklist to confirm that content is ready to be shared with the wider GitLab Learn audience:

#### Peer reviewing for GitLab Learning Evangelists

When completing a peer review, Learning Evangelists can

1. Ask the L&D team for support, or
1. Ask another Learning Advocate

As new team members are onboarded as Learning Evangelists, the L&D team will serve as the primary peer reviewers for contributed content. As the Learning Evangelists get more confident in the platform, a process will be developed to share and review content together. For now, please reach out to the L&D team in the [#learninganddevelopment Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CMRAWQ97W) and request for your learning content to be reviewed.

#### Content review checklist items

To review in the front end of GitLab Learn

1. Click into the `edit` mode to review content in each Journey or Pathway
1. Content is organized in a Pathway or Journey
1. Name is clear and identifies what the learner will achieve upon completion
1. Description of the Pathway or Journey clearly defines the content
1. Images are branded based on correct image guidelines
1. Learning level is set
1. Badge status is set and uploaded
1. Each SmartCard has a clear description

To review in the EdCast backend

1. Language is specified
1. Tags are added based on related content keywords
1. Relevant channels are included
1. User taxonomy topics are chosen

When the peer-review is complete, content should be switched on by the content creator to the `published` state.



### Sharing content

#### Using groups

Groups are best utilized to organize learners around a specific quality. Examples include role and team. Consider these best practices when creating a group:

1. Decide if your group is private or public. Private groups cannot be discovered by learners who are not members of the group. These are best used when you want to organize a group of only your direct team members. Public groups are discoverable by any learner on the platform. These are best used when you'd like to broadcast the group to a wide audience
1. If groups are not marked private, then members can click the option to join. If you want to make them visible and share with everyone, do not mark the group as private
1. Groups can be used to assign content to a specific group of people. Learning can be assigned to all members of a group
1. Content can be shared privatley with one or more groups. When its not shared with someone outside of that group, they won't discover it
1. When new members are added to a group, they will automatically be assigned all content that has been assigned to that group
1. Groups offer a space to create a community of learners around a similar topic or goal
1. All groups must have a group administrator that will take responsibility for managing content in the group, curating new content for the group, and creating new ways to maintain a community. Group admin are encouraged to open an MR to this page and add best practices for group management

##### Inviting new members to groups

Engage learners in groups using the following practices

1. Learners automatically added by the HRIS integration from BambooHR to groups based on their role in the organization
1. Manually adding users to groups by navigating to the group and clicking the `invite` option
1. Broadcast open groups on the Discover page to invite new members

##### Dynamic Group Workflows

Dynmaic group workflows automatically add users to groups based on user account settings. The integration with BambooHR allows GitLab team members to be sorted by team, role, location, etc. All data available to sort by in dynamic group workflows can be viewed in the `User` section under the `Accounts` tab. 

The following steps describe the process for creating a new dynamic group workflow.

1. Login to the EdCast admin panel
1. Under the `Accounts` tab, click on `Dynamic Group Management`
1. This pannel shows the status of all current dynamic group workflows, if the workflows are enabled, name, date created, and their owner. There is also the option to run, edit, view, or delete existing workflows.
1. Create a new workflow by clicking the `add new` button
1. Give a name to your workflow. It is best practice to make sure the name indicates what users will be moving through the workflow. Considering naming the workflow the same as the related group.
1. Use the `Criteria` tab to set the conditions of your workflow. These are set up similar to an `if` or `if, then` statement.
1. Choose a `column`. This data correlates directly to the columns of data pulled in from BambooHR for team members, listed on the `Users` admin page.
1. Set a condition. For example, use the `Equals` condition to indicate that the column variable you picked is `true`.
1. Choose a variable from the data `column` to sort by. For example, if you choose the `Role` column, your condition choices here will be `manager`, `individual contributor`, and `leader`.
1. The option exists to add a multiple rules if you need to make your workflow drill down into a more specific cross section of people. Use the `add rule` button to create another condition for your workflow.
1. In the `Configuration` tab, decide where this workflow will add users. Choose to create a new group, create a custom group, or add to an existing group.
1. Click `Save`. This will **not** run your workflow.
1. After saving, you'll return to the main `Dynamic Group Management` page. The new workflow will appear at the top of the list.
1. To run the workflow, toggle the button in the `Enable` column so that the workflow is `on`. Then, click the play button in the `Actions` column. This will start to run your workflow.
1. The EdCast platform runs these workflows on a certain cadence, so your groups might not populate right away. Check back on your workflow over the course of a few hours to confirm the workflow has run as expected.
1. Workflows in the `on` state will continuoulsy, adding new users to your group as they join the platform.
1. To stop the workflow, navigate to this `Dynamic Group Management` page and toggle your workflow to the `off` status.

Here is an example of a dynamic group workflow that pulls all GitLab team members into an existing group:

![workflow-image](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/workflow-example.png)

#### Broadcasting on Channels

Channels are used to collect and broadcast information based on like content. Users can follow channels to stay up to date on all new learning content in a specific area of interest. 

1. Use Channels to share content with a wider audience. For example, if the L&D team created a training on effective communication for the GitLab team and assigned it to the GitLab team group, the same content could be shared on a Remote Communication Channel so the wider community could train on this course as well
1. Channels should have a clear title and description that defines what content the user will find in the channel
1. SmartCards, Pathways, and Journeys can be shared to channels upon creation or can be added to relevant channels later on
1. Channels can have multiple curators to encourage collaboration and content sharing

#### How Learning Evangelists can share content

Learning Evangelists can use the following processes to broadcast or highlight their contributed content

1. Raise attention to new content with the L&D team via Slack. The team will help you determine the best Carousels, Groups, or Channels to broadcast your content
1. Share content with a Group you're a part of, like your team
1. Share content to a Channel with a relevant topic, like Remote Work Foundations

### Designing the discover page

The discover page is the page where learners will land upon logging into the LXP. On this page, users can discover new content, navigate to their followed channels, find their groups, and more.

The discover page can be leveraged by admin to: 

- advertise new learning opportunities
- share new channels
- highlight learning from specific users

The discover page is also curated based on the user. For example, if a carousel appears on the discover page that includes private groups, only groups that the user is a part of will appear.

Use these best practices when designing and updating the discover page in EdCast:

1. Consider multiple user perspectives when adding static content to the discover page. For example, the first iteration of the discover page includes links to EdCast user docs, which is relevant for all users in their first few times accessing the platform 
1. Use custom carousels to organize content by topic. Carousels can display either channels or users
1. Custom carousels with channels should be clearly named and invite the learner to explore a specific topic
1. Custom carousels with users should feature engaged learners and leaders in the platform 
1. Leverage a carousel of groups by creating SmartCards that link directly to groups that you want to highlight




## Processes, management, and maintenance of content in EdCast

This section documents specific workflows in EdCast that admin will use when creating and maintaining content. As the LXP implementation team discovers new ways to utilize EdCast, these processes shoud be updated. All admin should consider opening an MR to this page and workflows as they explore new tools in the platform.

     - Promote content using the toggle on/off option
     - Delete content using the trash icon
     - Edit backend content information by clicking on the pencil icon

##### Limitations of backend content editing

Edits that you'd like to made related to the arrangement of content in the LXP will be done in the front end. The following are examples of edits you **cannot** make in the admin section and will need to use the EdCast front end to edit:

- Arrangement of SmartCards in a Pathway, or Pathways in a Journey
- Badging information


### Channels

#### Creating a new channel

1. Login to Edcast and navigate to the `admin` panel
1. Click on the `content` tab
1. Click on `channels`
1. Click on `add channel`
1. In the `setup` tab, define the following for your channel:
     - Name: This is the name users will see on the discover page and across the top of the channel
     - Description: Provide a short text description about content this channel will broadcast
     - Profile image: Refer to the image guidelines below 
     - Topics: Add at least 3 topics to categorize content that will be in this channel. This will help users discover the channel in the platform
     - Provider: Define who is creating the channel or where the content is coming from. For example, 'GitLab Field Enablement Team'. This step is not required.
     - Provider Image: Add an image to correspond with the provider above. This step is not required. This image will overwrite the channel image
     - Private, Open, Allow Follow, and Automated Pin Cards: Confirm all permissions
1. Click `save channel`
1. After you click `save channel`, the following tabs will open for editing: `content`, `people` and `carousels`
1. These tabs will allow you to further define permissions for your channel. These are not required to create your channel, but will help customize and organize content. 

**Documentation Note:** For the purposes of MVC documentation, the L&D team will stop channel documentation here and iterate in the future as we discover how customization within these additional tabs can be leveraged.

#### Editing an existing channel

1. Login to Edcast and navigate to the `admin` panel
1. Click on the `content` tab

## Moderation DRIs

Moderation of user activity on the GitLab learn platform will be maintained by the LXP admin.

**Important Note:** As of 2021-02, the Learning and Development team does not have a current LXP admin. For the time being, the L&D team will work together to cover platform moderation.

## Moderation Workflows

1. Navigate to the EdCast admin panel
1. Click on `Content` -> `Reported Content` or `Reported Comment`
1. Options for reported content/comments include to `unreport` which will remove the reported flag and keep content/comments available to users, or `trash` which will delete the content from the platform.
1. If the content is in clear violation of our CoC, take the following actions:
     1. Choose the `trash` option to remove the content
     1. Open an issue on the EdCast Modteration issue board. Use the `moderation` issue template and fill in relevant user information
     1. In the issue, determine appropriate action for the user's account.
     1. If the user is to be suspended, email the user with the `CoC Violation` email template and suspend the user's account.
     1. Close the issue
1. If it is unclear if the content is in violation of our CoC, take the following actions:
     1. Open an issue on the EdCast Modteration issue board. Use the `moderation` issue template and fill in relevant user information
     1. In the issue, determine appropriate action for the user's account.
     1. Collaborate to determine the appropriate action for the user's account
     1. If the user is to be suspended, email the user with the `CoC Violation` email template and suspend the user's account.
     1. If the content is to remain on the platform, notify the user why the content was reported and reviewed.
     1. Close the issue


## Support

### Temporary Support Model

GitLab Learn is planned to launch to external audiences on 2021-03-15. Without a dedicated LXP admin, the implementation team will use this temporary support process across the Professional Services and Learning and Development Teams to enable and support all users.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Question] --> B[Determine user audience]
    B -->|Team Member| D[Support via Slack from L&D]
    B -->|Customer| E[Support via ticket from PS team]
    B -->|Community Member| F[Support via ticket from Professional Services and Forum support from L&D]
```

#### SLAs for temporary support workflow

GitLab team members should work towards responding to internal and external requests for support based on the following SLAs:

| Audience | Support Method | SLA |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Team Members | Slack support from L&D team | 2 business days |
| Customers | Zendesk support from PS team | TBD by PS Team |
| Community Members | Zendesk support from PS or L&D teams | 1 week |
| Community Members | Fourm support from L&D team | 1 week |

Workflows, email templates, and outlines below will remain the same for this temporary support model.

### End goal Support Model

This section outlines workflows and processes that the GitLab team uses to provide support to GitLab Learn users.

Due to the diversity in audience on the GitLab Learn platform, support is managed and supported by multiple teams at GitLab.

This workflow will be implemented when the LXP implementation team has adeuqate staffing for platform administration.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Question] --> B[Determine user audience]
    B -->|Team Member| D[Support via Slack from L&D]
    B -->|Customer| E[Support via ticket from PS team]
    B -->|Community Member| F[Support via ticket or Community Forum answer from LXP admin
```

### Pathways for user support

#### Slack support for team members

##### Slack workflow

GitLab team members are directed to seek support for the GitLab Learn platform in the #learninganddevelopment Slack channel. From this channel, the Learning and Development team will answer questions and support with platform issues. The L&D team monitors the #learninganddevelopment Slack thread daily. If questions are posed that L&D cannot solve, they will engage EdCast for further support via email.

Field sales team members might naturally reach out to exising channels of support from the Field Enabement team for their specific content. If Field Enablement questions are posted in the Learning and Development Slack channel, the team will route inquiries to the correct team member.

This chart outlines common questions and triage actions taken by the L&D team:

| Question Topic | Triage |
| ----- | ----- |
| Platform Permissions or Functionality | Check admin panel and engage EdCast when necessary |
| Learning Content | Support 1:1 in Slack |
| Content contribution process | Direct to Learning Evangelist Pathway |
| Field Enablement or Professional Services content | Tag FE and PS DRIs |


#### Zendesk support for customers and community members

Zendesk will be our main hub for providing user support for external audiences on GitLab Learn. 

Customers and community members will be directed to open a ticket using the professional services contact form.

The following workflow outlines how new tickets are directed to the appropriate Zendesk view:

```mermaid

graph TD;
A(User wants to contact proserv)
B(How does the user do it?)
C(Ticket goes to triage view)
D(Zapier tries to auto-associate)
E(Ticket is in triage view, needs to be manually triaged)
F(What plan did they say they were?)
G(Ticket is in paid view)
H(Ticket is in free view)
I(Zapier tries to auto-associate)
A-->B;
B--Email-->C;
C-->D;
D--Fails-->E;
B-->I;
D--Success-->G;
I--Success-->G;
I--Fails-->F;
F--Paid-->E;
F--Free-->H;

```

##### Customer support workflow using Zendesk(Paid Users)

The workflow for customers using the LXP will be determined by the Professional Services team via the `paid` Zendesk view.

##### Community support workflow using Zendesk (Free Users)

Zendesk tickets from users with free GitLab accounts or without a GitLab.com account will be routed to the `free` view and processed by the LXP admin.

When providing support to community members, please review the `Support for frequently asked questions` section below for common workflows and templates used to provide free support.

#### Community Forum Support (Paid and Free Users)

The GitLab Community Forum has a category entitled `GitLab Learn` for users to connect and ask questions about GitLab Learn. Responses to this category will be managed by the LXP admin.

Below are a collection of key questions and answers posted on the forum. Consider linking to these threads when providing support on the forum, in Zendesk, or in Slack.

| Question | Forum Thread Link |
| ----- | ----- | 
| | |
| | |

Important considerations when responding to questions in the forum:

1. If you need personal information from the user, direct them to open a ticket. This could include problems with logging in, accessing their account, or updating accout information.
1. Whenever possible, link back to the [GitLab Learn user docs](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/user/) in your response. If the information you're sharing isn't documented on that page, add it.
