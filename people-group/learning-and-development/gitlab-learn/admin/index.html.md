## Image guidelines

The L&D team is collaborating with the GitLab brand team to determine our best approach to using image in the LXP. Internal team members can refer to this [confidential issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/growth/-/issues/606#note_463614873) during the collaboration.

When image guidelines are set, this section will be udpated to reflect how the team will use images to communicate content in the LXP.
