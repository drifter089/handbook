## Project Management using GitLab

The LXP Implementation team uses [GitLab issue boards](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/edcast-lxp-implementation/-/boards) and [GitLab Epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/918) to track and collaborate on the roll out of the EdCast LXP.


## Temporary Support from EdCast using Slack

To streamline process of engaging EdCast in support realted questions, we've created the [#edcast-support](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C01LG39GLAU/thread/C010VVAT48Y-1611274804.010800) Slack channel. The LXP implementation team should use this channel for the following purposes:

1. Asking quick, support related questions about the EdCast or EdGraph platform
1. Checking on best practices and suggestions by the EdCast team
1. Following up on questions asked during office hour sessions


GitLab team memebers should following these best practices when interacting with the Edcast team in Slack.

1. Do not expect an immediate response from EdCast in Slack. Assume their team is checking Slack approximately 1x per day, similar to the cadence of email
1. Search the [GitLab Learn Admin docs](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/) and the Slack channel itself for the answer to your question before posting in the channel.
1. Post your question for EdCast in the channel and tag Katie and any other LXP implementation team who are involved in the conversation
1. When your question is answered, if it is not documented on the [GitLab Learn Admin docs](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/), open an MR and assign the MR to `@slee24` to merge.
