## Contributing to GitLab Learn as a Team Member

Team members have two paths they can follow to contribute learning content to the GitLab Learn platform. Review these scenarioes to decide which role best fits your needs:

| Scenario | Contributor Role |
| ----- | ----- |
| I want to make suggestions to team members on what existing learning material might be best for their professional development journey. For example, I want to pull together some LinkedIn Learning courses that would help them develop new skills | Curator |
| I'd like you create a brand new learning pathway for team members or the wider community. I plan on creating my own content, recording videos, designing handbook pages, and more to deliver this course | Learning Evangelist |

## Become a GitLab Learn Curator

Curators in GitLab Learn can organize existing learning content in their specific team Groups or Channels to broadcast, organize, and encourage professional development. This role is perfect for PBPs, leaders, or managers who'd like to make suggestions to their team regarding what LinkedIn Learning courses might be most beneficial!

## Become a GitLab Learning Evangelist

1. Democratize the learning process and provide space for all voices to be heard
