# GitLab Learn

## What is EdCast?

GitLab uses EdCast, a Learning Experience Platform (LXP). Our EdCast instance is named [GitLab Learn](https://gitlab.edcast.com/). At GitLab, we belive [everyone can contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/#mission), and our LXP is no different. [Everyone can contribute to GitLab Learn!](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/contribute/) 

You can read more about the mission and vision of the LXP on the [EdCast About Page](https://www.edcast.com/corp/about-us/)

Users of GitLab Learn can find support in our [user docs](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/user/) 

Admin can find best practices and workflows for creating and managing content in our [admin docs](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/admin/)

### What is a LXP?

A learning experience platform, or LXP, is [defined by EdCast](https://www.edcast.com/corp/blog/what-is-an-lxp/#:~:text=It%20brings%20together%20internal%2C%20external,the%20content%20to%20the%20user.) as a platform that "brings together internal, external, formal and informal sources of learning and knowledge in a simple, easy to use interface (UI), driving an intuitive user experience (Ux).  A key feature is that an LXP should use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to personalize the content to the user. An LXP should be available on the web, and on a mobile device, anytime, anywhere."

## GitLab's Long Term Strategic Vision for the LXP

Additional information about the long term strategic vision for GitLab Learn is coming soon.

## Content Roadmap

The GitLab team is excited about growing new learning opportunities for team members, partners, and our wider community on the GitLab Learn platform.

Future learning content coming to GitLab Learn:

1. Trainings for managers in an all-remote setting
1. Advanced GitLab topics


## What will GitLab Learn do for the GitLab community

GitLab has invested in the LXP to enable our team members, partners, customers, and the broader community a personalized, self-service learning platform to enable handbook first continuous learning. GitLab Learn will do the following for GitLab: 

- **Aggregate** all knowledge and learning content into one system for easier accessibilitiy 
- **Curate & Create** content that is [handbook first with interactivity](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/interactive-learning/)
- **Recommend** learning based on individual community member preferences
- **Learn & Guide** community members on how to develop new skills through step-by-step guides through individual learning styles
- **Automate** learning for personalized learning recommendations
- **Scale** learning to the wider GitLab community
- **On-Demand**, **Self-Paced** learning
- **Reduce** manual tasks associated with scaling
- **Enhance** training to be delivered in a fun and engaging way (erase your preconceived notions of LMS or LXP systems!)
- **Dogfood** the same LXP system that will be used for customer training offerings

### Why should GitLab teams add professional development material to GitLab Learn?

If your team has created learning paths or curated external resources for team member professional development, we highly suggest adding this content to the LXP. 

By using the LXP to administer learning, your team can:

1. Track completion and engagement of learning material
1. Share earned badges and certifications externally on your LinkedIn profile
1. Suggest related training based on previously completed or viewed content using machine learning in the EdCast platform
1. Enable other team members and community members to access learning content

If you're looking to collaborate with the Learning and Development team in adding content to GitLab Learn, please review the process on our [work with us handbook page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/work-with-us)


## Handbook first approach to the LXP

The GitLab LXP uses a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) approach for all learning content, using the handbook as our single source of truth for learning content. Contributors to the LXP will use the platform to [find and curate](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/interactive-learning/) relevant content that exists in the handbook using a structured process. 


## Governance

[Implementation of the EdCast LXP](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/implementation) at GitLab requires cross-functional collaboration across organizations to serve various audience needs.
