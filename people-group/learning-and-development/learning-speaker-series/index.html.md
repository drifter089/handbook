## Learning Speaker Series Overview

At GitLab, the Learning and Development team hosts a monthly Learning Speaker Series call, open to all team members. These calls serve to provide space where senior executives and mid-level people leaders can share relevant topics to engage and teach team members lessons learned from their own careers and answer relevant L&D related questions.

### Goals
1. Spur a culture of curiosity and continuous learning by highlighting all the great initiatives we have taking place in learning & development.
1. Highlight all of the great initiatives underway within Learning & Development
1. Provide a forum where team members can hear from established leaders on how they've managed their career and lessons learned to share. 

Additional background information on this initiaitve is available in the [Monthly Continuous Learning Call issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/96)
