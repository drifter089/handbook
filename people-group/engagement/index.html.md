### Engagement Survey Overview

Team Member Engagement is important to the continued success of GitLab making the Engagement Survey an important element within the annual `People Group` calendar.  Engagement strategies have been shown to reduce attrition; improve productivity and efficiency; further embed the company values and ultimately enhance role satisfaction.  

One of the ways that GitLab tracks team member engagement is through the bi-annual `Team Member Engagement Survey` administered by [CultureAmp](https://www.cultureamp.com/) and facilitated by our team of [People Operations Specialists](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/people-ops/people-operations/#people-operations-specialist) - this program is comprised of a mid-year pulse survey followed by a more intensive full-spectrum survey rolled out in the last quarter of the GitLab Financial Year.  

Engagement surveys are geared toward giving team members an opportunity to provide feedback in terms of their experience within GitLab touching on pertinent elements such as `Company Culture`, `Teamwork`, `Management` and `Wellbeing` among others.  

Feedback from the survey in turn allows Leadership within GitLab to gain insight into what is most important to team members, in particular what the business is doing well and what may need future iteration with the intention of improving the underlying team member experience and ensuring healthy levels of attrition are maintained.

#### Survey Confidentiality 
In an effort to ensure team member confidentiality is upheld, only managers with >5 respondents will be able to view quantitavive results - this is carried across to demographic filtering in teams with population sizes which exceed the minimum too.

#### Survey Sections and Factors
The GitLab Team Member Engagement Survey is comprised of eleven sections each of which is aligned to a specific area of focus otherwise known as a factor.

The survey factors for FY19 through FY21 were as follows with each section including three to eight questions - the most recent survey was comprised of fifty-four questions in total building out the original forty-six to include insight gathering around COVID-19.  The format of the survey was predominantly Likert or Rating Scale with a handful of freetext questions or comments toward the end.

1. Section 01: GitLab Overall
1. Section 02: Company Confidence
1. Section 03: Our Leaders
1. Section 04: Your Manager
1. Section 05: Teamwork
1. Section 06: Your Role
1. Section 07: The Culture
1. Section 08: Growth and Development
1. Section 09: Wellbeing COVID-19
1. Section 10: Action
1. Section 11: Comments (Free Text)

#### Taking Action
Once the GitLab Team Member Engagement Survey has been closed out, reports will be dissementated to the E-Group and Divisional Heads for review i.e. only those with team populations >5.  These will form the basis of discussion when collaboratively compiling the people strategy for year ahead in conjunction with additional data such as attrition reports etc.

Each E-Group member will in collaboration with their repesctive People Business Partner (PBP) identify one or two acton items to initiate coming out of the results review - these will be tracked and managed within CultureAmp moving forward.
