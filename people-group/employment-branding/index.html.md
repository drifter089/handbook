## Introduction

As a global, all-remote company, GitLab has a unique story to tell.
A key part of telling that story is sharing what it's like to work here, because we wouldn't be successful without our people and our culture.
This page outlines our approach to talent brand at GitLab.

## Defining our talent brand vision

![Talent brand vision statement](/sites/handbook/source/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/Talent_Brand_Vision.png/)

There are two parts to this vision: 

1. Continually building a company with a values-led, remote culture where people can contribute and thrive
1. Becoming increasingly well known both externally and internally for being this type of workplace

To achieve the first part, we need to ensure that we’re building a workplace that fits this description. To achieve the second part, we need a thoughtful go-to-market strategy so that over time we become more well known for these things.

## Achieving our talent brand vision

To work toward our defined vision, we believe that continually improving on, highlighting, and sharing the following things about GitLab put us on a path toward realizing this vision. 

This will require close collaboration with all parts of the People and Marketing Groups as we’ll want to ensure that we promote and communicate the things that move us closer to fulfilling our vision.

As we build GitLab into one of the world’s best workplaces, we will look to increasingly educate candidates and team members about 3 themes that set us apart from other workplaces.


#### GitLab is a place where...

1. **Everyone can contribute**

    - We’ve got big ambitions to make GitLab the [top DevOps platform](/solutions/devops-platform/) and need skilled contributors to get us there.
    - Our [mission](/company/mission/) makes it clear that we believe in a world where everyone can contribute. We make that possible at GitLab by [running our operations](/handbook/using-gitlab-at-gitlab/) on our product. This means everything is read-write by default.
    - We operate around the world. We welcome people of all backgrounds to contribute to our success and have built [Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging programs](/company/culture/inclusion/) and practices into all parts of our company.
    

1. **Anyone can thrive**

    - Building a company where anyone can thrive means putting in place the programs needed for our team members to manage their [health, wealth, and well-being](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/) regardless of location.
    - [Career development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/), clarity in expectations by having defined performance indicators, [learning & development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/), and access to opportunity are all things that are top of mind as we grow GitLab.

1. **We foster a values-led, remote culture**

    - Our [CREDIT values](/handbook/values/) drive a culture that’s built to operate in an [all-remote environment](/company/culture/all-remote/guide/). Because we’re all-remote, we aim to stay at the forefront of best practices & building culture.
    - Our [handbook-led approach](/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) and async working style highlight our values-led, remote culture.

## Key ways we bring this value proposition to life

- **Talent brand marketing:** Aligning our value proposition with a go-to-market plan so that key candidate audiences are aware of GitLab. Matching the look & feel of recruiting materials with the GitLab brand, and creating external campaigns.

- **Content development:** Creation and distribution of candidate & careers content that further our talent acquisition and talent attraction goal.

- **Education & Enablement:** Maintaining the internal & external sources that inform and engage candidates from pre-apply to hired.

- **Partners & Sponsorships:** Identifying and building relationships with digital & events partners that can help us reach new audiences

- **Team member engagement:** Bring team members along on the journey through storytelling, empower team members to become GitLab ambassadors, and share information transparently so that the company we’re building reflects the company we’re promoting.

We use a number of tactics to bring GitLab’s value proposition to life. Using talent brand marketing and content development we’ll create candidate-facing materials that show GitLab as an employer of choice. Additionally, candidate and public engagement & education alongside partnerships & sponsorships will provide added evidence that our value proposition is an accurate reflection of who we are as a company. Lastly, internal communication will bring team members on the journey with us and help engage team members so that our culture remains strong.

As we consider the ways in which we will bring our value proposition to life, we’ve also landed on several design principles to help guide the tactics we choose to deploy within the key areas mentioned above.

## Design principles that underpin our strategy

- **Do less, but go bigger:** We’re currently spread too thin given the amount of context shifting across tactics; we’ll decide which tactics look most promising and put our focus there.

- **Measure & analyze to continually improve over time:** We need to choose tactics that can be measured and understood so that we can align on ways to improve.

- **Nail the basics:** We need to do a better job of getting the basics right (i.e. how we post jobs, what our job ads look like, social media sharing).

- **Invite GitLab team members to be a part of the journey:** Bring team members along on the journey through storytelling, empower team members to become GitLab ambassadors and seek input from across the company to continually iterate.

### Review sites

We want to be sure candidates who come across GitLab's profile on employer review sites have an accurate picture of what it's like to work here.
There are some sites where GitLab has a company profile, but we do not own it or pay for additional features. On others, we have a managed presence.

We encourage team members to leave reviews and share their stories on these sites to continue to keep an updated profile. We welcome both positive and negative feedback in these reviews.

#### Glassdoor

##### Engaged employer

As an engaged employer with Glassdoor, we're able to customize the branded content, videos, links, and images on our Glassdoor profile. Our contract with Glassdoor includes pages in these countries:
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Germany
- The Netherlands
- India
- Ireland
- Rest of World (all countries where Glassdoor does not have a separate presence)

##### Responding to Glassdoor reviews

The [Talent Brand Manager](/job-families/people-ops/talent-branding-manager/) keeps track of new company reviews and escalates them as needed for an external response and internal action. [Here's our process](/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/glassdoor-escalation/) for tracking and escalating reviews.

##### OpenCompany designation

As an open, transparent company, the OpenCompany designation is important for us to have to best represent our talent brand. We take action to maintain this status throughout the year.

Achieving and maintaining OpenCompany requires that you:
- Keep company profile up to date
- Add 5-10 new photos every 12 months
- Get 5-60 new employee reviews (depending on company size) every 12 months
- Respond to 2-10 reviews (depending on company size) every 12 months


##### Profile updates on Glassdoor

To be sure the details on our profile stay up to date, we [review these items](https://gitlab.com/gl-talent acquisition/talent-brand/-/issues/9) quarterly and make any needed updates:
- Headcounts and country numbers listed on our profile
- Our status as one of the world's largest all-remote companies
- New awards or recognition
- Photos or videos recently published


#### Comparably

Comparably is an employer review site that also offers recruitment marketing tools and [award programs](/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/#employer-awards-and-recognition). We no longer have a paid profile with Comparably (ended in 2020).

Our goal on the site is to maintain our profile and keep the feedback up to date by annually (Q3) sending a link to all team members where they can consider leaving feedback or a review.
