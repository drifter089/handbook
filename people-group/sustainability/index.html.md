## Sustainability at GitLab

As GitLab's reach on the global developer community grows, so to does our impact on the environment. While we intentionally operate within our values as a part of our operations, we have not yet understood how to apply our values on the impact our business has on the environment. This handbook page will document our growing body of work in aligning our sustainability initiatives with our values. 

## GitLab's mission can't succeed without sustainability 

## We'll let our values drive us

## We recognize the truth

In order for our values to drive us to the right emissions reduction solutions, we'll need to recognize some truths that outline where we are today.

##### The internet is a major carbon emitter

What's out of sight is usually out of mind. So it's important that we recognize the truth: The emissions of the internet (gadgets, systems required to operate, and the internet itself) accounts for approximately 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions - **similar in size and scope to the emissions produced by the airline industry**. _source: [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think)_

##### It's our responsbility and we must be held accountable

- Emissions caused by GitLab's business operations are GitLab's emissions to reduce now and eliminate soon.
- Waste produced by our business operations is GitLab's waste to process.
- Inequity produced by our business operations is GitLab's inequity to correct.

Any unintended negative side effect of GitLab's business operations is GitLab's responsibility to take action on and to correct.

By beginning work on internal sustainability initiatives, we're focusing our efforts on holding ourselves accountable rather than waiting until it is required through cultural or regulatory means.

We hope to advocate for this position in our strategies and in the greater context of the global sustainability movement.

##### GitLab will eventually be required to operate a sustainable business

Either by cultural or governing body regulations, most businesses won't be allowed to operate without a sustainable business strategy and public reporting on their efforts. We choose to organize our strategy before these regulations take effect and hope to advocate for these kinds of policies in the greater context of the global sustainability movement.

## What we believe

We still have a lot to learn. But what we know today helps us to define how we'll move our sustainability initiatives forward.

##### Being All-Remote is an advantage and a unique challenge for sustainability work
GitLab has eliminated a significant amount of emissions by not having a daily commute to work. However, we've also complicated our ability to account for the different types of electrcity use. In a co-located office in a traditional company, there is one electric bill. But in an all-remote company in over 60 countries, emissions generated from team member electricity use get more challenging to reduce or eliminate as the team grows. 

Emissions caused by team member electricity use for GitLab's business operations are the responsibility of GitLab to reduce now and eliminate soon. 

##### It's about acting as a fiduciary for our Team Members, Customers, Community, and Planet

While most sustainability initatives focus on things we can do help the planet, the outcomes are intended on helping people. In order for us to take the lives and wellbeing of our team members, customers, and the community seriously, we need to act as a fiduciary for the planet.

##### We have a lot of work to do
Depending on how you look at the companies of the world and their commitments to sustaiability, GitLab may seem behind on the times. 

##### We must center our actions in equity

This deserves a special callout for discussing our values. While Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging is a critical GitLab value, we must understand that witout intentionally working equity into our sustainability initiatives, we are not adequetley supporting our team members, customers, community or the planet. 

##### Reduce now, eliminate soon

## Sustainable projects already in motion

## What comes next?
