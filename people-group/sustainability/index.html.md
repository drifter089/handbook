## Sustainability at GitLab

As GitLab's reach in the global developer community grows, so does our impact on the environment. While we intentionally operate within our values as part of our operations, we have not yet understood how to apply our values to our business's impact on the environment. This handbook page will document our growing body of work in aligning our sustainability initiatives with our values. 

## GitLab's mission can't succeed without sustainability 

[GitLab's mission is to create a world where everyone can contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/#mission). When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors, and we greatly `increase the rate of human progress`.

_How_ and _if_ we can increase the rate of human progress is limited by humans' ability to focus on contributing. Today, we see a reduction in contributions when someone is located where extreme weather events like floods or wildfires occur. Tomorrow, we may see a drop in contributions due to dramatic shifts in weather patterns. 

The wider community's total contributions are at risk of permanent reduction when large groups of people are required to migrate due to climate change. [This is already beginning to happen today](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html). 

If we don't hold ourselves accountable for sustainability, GitLab will continue to attack our mission, reducing the possibility of long-term success.

## We recognize the truth

We'll need to recognize some truths that outline where we are today for our values to drive us to the proper emissions reduction solutions.

#### The internet is a significant carbon emitter

What's out of sight is usually out of mind. So we must recognize the truth: The emissions of the internet (gadgets, systems required to operate, and the internet itself) accounts for approximately 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions - **similar in size and scope to the emissions produced by the airline industry**. _source: [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think)_

#### It's our responsibility, and we must be held accountable

- Emissions caused by GitLab's business operations are GitLab's emissions to reduce now and eliminate soon.
- Waste produced by our business operations is GitLab's waste to process.
- Inequity produced by our business operations is GitLab's inequity to correct.

Any unintended negative side effect of GitLab's business operations is GitLab's responsibility to take action on and to correct.

By beginning work on internal sustainability initiatives, we're focusing our efforts on holding ourselves accountable rather than waiting until required through cultural or regulatory means.

We hope to advocate for this position in our strategies and the global sustainability movement's greater context.

#### GitLab will eventually be required to operate a sustainable business

Either by cultural or governing body regulations, most businesses won't operate without a sustainable business strategy and public reporting on their efforts. We choose to organize our strategy before these regulations take effect and hope to advocate for these kinds of policies in the global sustainability movement's greater context.

## What we believe

We still have a lot to learn. But what we know today helps us to define how we'll move our sustainability initiatives forward.

#### Being All-Remote is an advantage and a unique challenge for sustainability work
GitLab has eliminated a significant amount of emissions by not having a daily commute to work. However, we've also complicated our ability to account for the different types of electricity use. In a co-located office in a traditional company, there is one electric bill. But in an all-remote company in over 60 countries, emissions generated from team member electricity use get more challenging to reduce or eliminate as the team grows. 

Emissions caused by team member electricity use for GitLab's business operations are the responsibility of GitLab to reduce now and eliminate soon. 

#### We must act as a fiduciary for our Team Members, Customers, Community, and Planet

While most sustainability initiatives focus on things we can do to help the planet, the outcomes are intended on helping people. To take the lives and wellbeing of our team members, customers, and the community seriously, we need to act as a fiduciary for the planet.

#### We have a lot of work to do

Depending on how you look at the world's companies and their commitments to sustainability, GitLab may seem behind on the times. Many of our partners and competitors have already made public commitments to operating more sustainably. But this is also an excellent gauge to research the commitment levels across the industry and make sure that GitLab's commitments don't just sound nice but ladder to actual targets.

#### We must center our actions on equity

While diversity is a critical GitLab value, we must understand that we are not adequately supporting our team members, customers, community, or the planet without intentionally working equity into our sustainability initiatives. 

#### Reduce now, eliminate soon

We don't know what our philosophy on sustainability will be yet. We don't have more information to share on what commitments we'll soon make. But we do know that we'll need to focus on reducing our emissions now to begin to eliminate those emissions soon. 

## Quantifying carbon emissions and offsets

While we can do more to understand our carbon footprint, we have begun to quantify our CO2 emissions and invest in offsets. For FY22, we did a rough estimate across four key emissions contribution areas.

1. **Data Centers**
GitLab uses the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP is already carbon neutral: https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/region-carbon. As a future iteration, we could partner with GCP to explore whether we could reallocate our server choices for cleaner energy upfront. We estimate 0 tons of CO2 to offset in FY22.

1. **Travel**
    1. **[Contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/events/gitlab-contribute/)** is a global GitLab event that includes team members in addition to the broader community. The in-person Contribute was cancelled in FY21 and FY22 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it will be a material C02 contributor in future years. For Contribute 2020, [Pachama](https://pachama.com/about), a company dedicated to solving climate change, calculated the carbon emissions for 1,000 people flying an average of 10,000 miles (round-trip) and staying a week at a conference. It determined we would contribute 1,379 tons of CO2. We can use this as a baseline in making assupmtions around emissions for future Contributes.
    1. **[Work travel]** has been low in 2020 and 2021, so we used 2019 travel as a baseline and focused on [field team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/) travels as the field team accounts for the majority of GitLab team member travels. Using [myclimate.org's](https://co2.myclimate.org/en/portfolios?calculation_id=4024000) calculator, we determined that a round trip regional flight on economy (New York City, NY to Atlanta, Georgia USA) for one person would have 0.5 tons of emmissions. In an average year, a field person would make an average of 30 trips. With a team of roughly 300, we would estimate 4,500 tons of emissions, but actual emissions in FY21 and FY22 have been much lower due to reduced travel due to the pandemic. As a conservative estimate for FY22, we assume that the field team travels 1/3 of the usual amount (10 trips in FY22).

1. **Team Member Work from Home Emissions**
GitLab team members [work remotely](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/), so there are no central offices. Accordingly, some amount of home energy use should be attributed to GitLab work. In April 2020, [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) estimated the [annual CO2 emissions for home energy usage per person](https://buffer.com/resources/carbon-footprint/) in an average household of three people in California is around 1.39 tons. We assume that this is the typical energy usage for a household and conservatively estimate that 60% of the emissions (0.834 tons) for such a household is attributable to GitLab work. With 1300 team members, we'd have 1084 tons of emissions per year.

**This is our FY22 estimate based on the above information**
| Emissions Category | Team Members in Group | Tons CO2 Emissions per Member | Total CO2 Emissions |
| ------ | ------ |------ | ------ |
| Data Centers | NA |NA | 0 |
| Travel: Contribute | 0 |0 | 0 |
| Travel: Work Travel | 300 | 5 | 1500 |
| Work from Home | 1300 |0.834 | 1084 |
| Total |  | | 2,584 |

We assume that CO2 emissions offsets are about $13 USD per ton. This is a very conservative assumption as we have seen a range from $3 to $13 per ton when we did this analysis in FY22-Q2. The offset for this iteration would be $33,592.

These are rough estimates and there is more that we can do to continue to refine our calcuation in future iterations. For example:
1. Consider vendor business offsets and adjust GitLab's based on findings
1. Travel in addition to plane travel
1. Consider non-field team member travel beyond Contribute
1. Update for future years as travel picks up post-pandemic

## GitLab Offsets

In 2020, GitLab purchased 1379 tons of carbon credits from Pachama for $4,964 in order to offset Contribute travel for 1000 employees. The Contribute event was cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In the second quarter of calendar year 2021, GitLab donated $248,860 to Pachama for 19182 tons of carbon credits. While we have yet do an in depth analysis, we believe that this donation should have made GitLab [carbon negative](https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/carbon-neutral-vs-carbon-negative-whats-the-difference/) as GitLab as GitLab was incorporated in 2014 and didn't have more than 100 people until 2016. If we did not have the pandemic in FY22, we believe that we would have seen the following emissions:

| Emissions Category | Team Members in Group | Tons CO2 Emissions per Member | Total CO2 Emissions |
| ------ | ------ |------ | ------ |
| Data Centers | NA |NA | 0 |
| Travel: Contribute | 1000 | 1.5 | 1500 |
| Travel: Work Travel | 300 | 15 | 4500 |
| Work from Home | 1300 |0.834 | 1084 |
| Total |  | | 7084 |

At $13 per ton of CO2 offset, we would have anticipated $92,092 in offset expenses in 2021 for an average of 1250 team members or ~$74 USD and 5.67 tons per team member. Scaling with rough company size for :

| Fiscal Year | Estimated Employee Number | Total CO2 Emissions |
| ------ | ------ |------ | 
| 2014 | 50 | 284 |
| 2015 | 120 | 680 |
| 2016 | 200 | 1,134 |
| 2017 | 300 | 1,701 |
| 2018 | 350 | 1,985 |
| 2019 | 700 | 3,969 |
| 2020 | 1200 | 2,481* |
| 2021 | 1250 | 2,584* |
*Scaled down due to Covid-19 travel reduction.

This amounts to 14,817 tons of CO2 emissions and $192,626 in expense through the end of 2021. 

We'll continue to increaese our sophistication of calculation and explore opportunities for future investment.
