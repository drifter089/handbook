## Sustainability at GitLab

As GitLab's reach in the global developer community grows, so to does our impact on the environment. While we intentionally operate within our values as a part of our operations, we have not yet understood how to apply our values on the impact our business has on the environment. This handbook page will document our growing body of work in aligning our sustainability initiatives with our values. 

## GitLab's mission can't succeed without sustainability 

[GitLab's mission is to create world where everyone can contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/#mission). When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors and we greatly `increase the rate of human progress`.

_How_ and _if we can permenantly_ increase the rate of human progress is limited by humans' ability to focus on contributing. Today, we see a reduction in contributions when someone is located where there are extreme weather events like floods or wildfires. Tomorrow, we may see a drop in contributions due to dramatic shifts in weather patterns. 

The total contributions of the wider community are at risk of permanet reduction, or even elimination, when [large groups of people will be required to relocate from their homes and disrupt their lives as migration due to climate change begins to take a larger toll on the planet than it is already taking today](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html). 

If we don't hold ourselves accountable for sustainability, GitLab will continue to attack our own mission, reducing the possibility of long term success.

## We'll let our values drive us

## We recognize the truth

In order for our values to drive us to the right emissions reduction solutions, we'll need to recognize some truths that outline where we are today.

#### The internet is a major carbon emitter

What's out of sight is usually out of mind. So it's important that we recognize the truth: The emissions of the internet (gadgets, systems required to operate, and the internet itself) accounts for approximately 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions - **similar in size and scope to the emissions produced by the airline industry**. _source: [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think)_

#### It's our responsbility and we must be held accountable

- Emissions caused by GitLab's business operations are GitLab's emissions to reduce now and eliminate soon.
- Waste produced by our business operations is GitLab's waste to process.
- Inequity produced by our business operations is GitLab's inequity to correct.

Any unintended negative side effect of GitLab's business operations is GitLab's responsibility to take action on and to correct.

By beginning work on internal sustainability initiatives, we're focusing our efforts on holding ourselves accountable rather than waiting until it is required through cultural or regulatory means.

We hope to advocate for this position in our strategies and in the greater context of the global sustainability movement.

#### GitLab will eventually be required to operate a sustainable business

Either by cultural or governing body regulations, most businesses won't be allowed to operate without a sustainable business strategy and public reporting on their efforts. We choose to organize our strategy before these regulations take effect and hope to advocate for these kinds of policies in the greater context of the global sustainability movement.

## What we believe

We still have a lot to learn. But what we know today helps us to define how we'll move our sustainability initiatives forward.

#### Being All-Remote is an advantage and a unique challenge for sustainability work
GitLab has eliminated a significant amount of emissions by not having a daily commute to work. However, we've also complicated our ability to account for the different types of electrcity use. In a co-located office in a traditional company, there is one electric bill. But in an all-remote company in over 60 countries, emissions generated from team member electricity use get more challenging to reduce or eliminate as the team grows. 

Emissions caused by team member electricity use for GitLab's business operations are the responsibility of GitLab to reduce now and eliminate soon. 

#### We must act as a fiduciary for our Team Members, Customers, Community, and Planet

While most sustainability initatives focus on things we can do help the planet, the outcomes are intended on helping people. In order for us to take the lives and wellbeing of our team members, customers, and the community seriously, we need to act as a fiduciary for the planet.

#### We have a lot of work to do

Depending on how you look at the companies of the world and their commitments to sustaiability, GitLab may seem behind on the times. Many of our partners and competitors have already made public commitments to operate more sustainably. But this is also a good gauge to research the commitment levels across the industry and to make sure that GitLab's commitments don't just sound nice, but ladder to real targets.

#### We must center our actions in equity

While Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging is a critical GitLab value, we must understand that witout intentionally working equity into our sustainability initiatives, we are not adequetley supporting our team members, customers, community or the planet. 

#### Reduce now, eliminate soon

We don't know what our philosophy on sustainability will be yet. We don't have more information to share on what commitments we'll soon make. But we do know that we'll need to focus on reducing our emissions now so that we can begin to eliminate those emissions in the near future.
