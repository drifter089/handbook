## Team Member Relations Specialist

The team member relations specialist is responsible for facilitiating and resolving all people matter related team member issues.   They will also assist in creating and informing team members of policies that are fair and consistent for all GitLab team members. As part of the people group the team member relations specialist works with both the manager and team member in an intermediary function to understand and help resolve workplace issues.  The team member relations specialist can also help coach and advise managers and team members on policies and processes.

Team member relation issues can range from simple coaching questions to serious code of conduct violations.  We classify these different level of team member cases by tiers. Example of issues/cases by tier level:

**Tier 1**

- Coaching support
- Performance Management
- Unprofessional behavior
- Relocation concerns
- Absenteeism

**Tier 2**

- [Job abandonment](/handbook/people-group/people-policy-directory/#job-abandonment)
- Manager/team member conflict resolution
- Team member/team member conflict resolution

**Tier 3**

- Ethic Violations
- Harrassment
- Retaliation
- Any Code of Conduct Violation

All Tier 3 cases will be managed together with Legal and the TMR specialist.

### Discussing Private Concerns

Team members who would like to discuss a private matter should send an email requesting support from our Team Member Relations Specialist to teammemberrelations@gitlab.com.  Please include the following in your email:

 - Subject Line should be  "New Request for assistance"
 - Name of Team member requesting support (Name of the person sending the email)
 - Team members location (example Orlando, Florida or Berlin, Germany) for managers who are requesting support regarding a team member issue on their team please use the location of the team member and not your location. 
 - Tier level as listed above

The Team Member Relations Specialist will reach out within 24 hours from when the request was sent via email during the business week.  

GitLab also offers a [Harassment Complaint Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xk5SXvh2kpO-w-TdykiczjhXNrEBjbMwDQHEt6lMhIk/edit?usp=sharing) that any team member may use to document any instance of any type of workplace harassment. Simply copy the form, fill it out with your information and send it to our Team Member Relations Specialist at teammemberrelations@gitlab.com.

Team members and the team member relations specialist should both respond to questions or queries via slack or email within 24 hours to continue making progress on the issue and get to a timely resolution.   The current team member relations team is listed below:

- US team members relations point of contact is Amy Tisdale (`atisdale-ext@gitlab.com`)
- EMEA and APAC team members relations point of contact is David Cives (`dcives-ext@gitlab.com`) 

For urgent requests that need immediate attention please Slack or email Amy Tisdale (`atisdale-ext@gitlab.com`) or David Cives (`dcives-ext@gitlab.com`) If you are unable to reach Amy Tisdale or Daivd Cives, below is the escalation path:

An urgent request would be something that needs immediate attention like team members safety or a code of conduct violation.
