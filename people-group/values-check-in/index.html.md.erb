## Values Check-In Survey

GitLab's [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) are a crucial part of our [competencies list](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#list) and are considered essential for team members to learn and live out, irrespective of role or team. To ensure all team members are living out and practicing GitLab's values, we have implemented a Values Check-In survey for new team members and their managers after 8-10 weeks with the company. The purpose of the check-in is to ensure alignment from a performance perspective and understanding of expectations with regard to the values.
GitLab's [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) check-in process is to check in with new hires on day 90. This is to ensure that the that we check in with team members, make sure they are supported, feedback on their first 60 to 90 days at GitLab and iterate on valuable feedback. This is not a performance check-in, any [underformance](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/underperformance/) discussions should be held by the manager of the team member directly. 

The People Experience Associate team sends out the survey on day 90. The feedback shared should be utilised to iterate on onboarding initiatives, people experience initiatives, and if more serious or sensitive, escalated to the People Business Partner of the department the team member is in. 

The aim of this check-in is to ensure continuous improvement through analysis of trends and feedback, with a positive side-effect that will attribute to great retention and values alignment. This is also an opportunity reiterate our values and encourage [certification in our values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#gitlab-values-certification). 

### Team Member Check-In

When you receive the dedicated email from the People Experience team, complete the Team Member Values Check-In form. When you submit your form, you will also receive a receipt of your submissions. Communicate with your manager that you have completed your review and if you are comfortable, discuss the feedback you shared with your manager. This would be valuable feedback for your manager on how your first 60 days have been since joining GitLab. 

### Timeline

Team members will have ~_2 weeks_ to complete the survey once it is received. It is essential that the survey is completed in a timely fashion, to help us iterate faster and continue to create a great team member experience at GitLab!
