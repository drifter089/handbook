## Overview
To assure our SSoT data in BambooHR is always correct and compliant we run audits on this data. 

## Weekly New hires
Once / week we run the audit on all the team members who started the week before. A spreadsheet is created 
in a Google Drive folder that is shared with Total Rewards and the VP People Operations, Technology & Analytics.

## Monthly all Team Members
Once / month we run the audit on all the active team members at GitLab. A spreadsheet is created 
in a Google Drive folder that is shared with Total Rewards and the VP People Operations, Technology & Analytics.
