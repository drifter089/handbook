Sitting at the intersection of [Data Analytics](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/finance/data-analyst) and [Data Engineering](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/finance/data-engineer), **Analytics Engineers** are responsible for translating data discovery, insights, and analysis needs into simple, efficient, and integrated data models and products, powered by the [Enterprise Data Platform](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform). Analytics Engineers play a major role in how efficient and effective all analytics is performed because their results are leveraged across all teams at GitLab and in dozens of use cases. The successful Analytics Engineer blends business acumen with technical expertise and can easily transition from business strategy to writing code to transform data.

## Responsibilities

As a team member responsible for helping to bridge the business-to-technology gap, the Analytics Engineer role requires equal amounts business acumen and technical acumen.

* Collaborate with team members to collect business requirements, define successful analytics outcomes, and design data models and engineering strategy.
* Builds trust in all interactions and with the data models themselves
* Serve as the [Directly Responsible Individual](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals) for major sections of the [Enterprise Dimensional Model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/data-edw)
* Design, develop, and extend [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) code to extend the Enterprise Dimensional Model
* Create and maintain architecture and systems documentation in the [Data Team Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team)
* Maintain the [Data Catalog](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog), an infinitely scalable resource to support Self-Service and Single-source-of-truth analysis
* Document results in either issue/MR templates, the [handbook](/handbook/), or READMEs so your learnings turn into repeatable actions and then into automation following the GitLab tradition of [handbook first!](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first)
* Implement the [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps) philosophy in everything you do
* Craft code that meets our internal standards for style, maintainability, and best practices (such as the [SQL Style Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/sql-style-guide)) for a high-scale database environment. Maintain and advocate for these standards through code review.
* Approve data model changes as a Data Team [Reviewer](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/how-we-work/duties/#reviewer) and [code owner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) for specific database and data model schemas
* Provide data modeling expertise to all GitLab teams through code reviews, pairing, and training to help deliver optimal, DRY, and scalable database designs and queries in Snowflake and in Periscope.
