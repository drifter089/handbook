##  Data Analyst Roles at GitLab

GitLab is one of the most _data-informed-and-driven_ companies you'll find.

Data is used by every team and every person, helping us better understand our customers, products, and performance. As an all-remote company, sharing performance metrics helps us [collaborate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration) better, align on [results](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#results) better, and perform our day-to-day jobs [transparently](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency).  As a Data Analyst, you'll have the opportunity work on a wide variety of problems and influence GitLab's performance, our customer's experience, and how we develop overall.
