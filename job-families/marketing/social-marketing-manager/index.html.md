## Social Marketing Jobs at GitLab

Social Media requires a balance of work behind each of the two words that make up the practice. _Social_, by building trust with our audiences and connecting as personally as appropriate, and _Media_, by scaling our storytelling efforts to brand-level corporate marketing initiatives.

#### The "Social" in Social Media
{:.no_toc}
The world's best brands feel more like a trusted source of information to their audience than a company. They could even develop friendly relationships with their followers. This is because the world's best brands understand people and weave that understanding into everything they do. Social Marketing at GitLab is a key part of building GitLab's brand into one that is loved by its audience of developers, remote work pros, and IT folks up and down the ladder.

Social Marketing at GitLab focuses on understanding people who make up the GitLab community, creating and sharing content over social channels that they'll find valuable, and educating team members in marketing and beyond on social media best practices for brands, personalities, and how we measure success.

#### The "Media" in Social Media
{:.no_toc}
The world's most renowned brands are perceived to be larger than life. As GitLab scales to new heights, the Social Marketing team prioritizes opportunities for brand-level storytelling initiatives. By sharing our company values, perspectives on remote work, or leaning into our product's features, we'll help users understand how they feel about GitLab overall.

#### Our perspective on the practice of Social Media
{:.no_toc}
GitLab is a unique company to work for. While the demands of social marketing don't necessarily turn off, our team has leaned into GitLab's values as a way to build the social marketing department of the future. We do best-in-class work and deliver on our expectations but do not allow the perils of working in social media to burn us out or damage our mental health. We take our company values seriously and integrate them into our daily work as often as possible.

## Responsibilities
_Vary by job grade but include:_

- Design and execute our global social strategies
- Manage risks to the GitLab brand and navigate crises 
- Day-to-day engagement with the community
- Develop and publish unique social content
- Support integrated marketing campaigns, events, and other initiatives
- Report on social performance, including insights and forecasts
- Conduct research from listening and other sources to provide quantitative and qualitative feedback to teams across the company

## Requirements
_Vary by job grade but include:_

- In-depth knowledge and an always up-to-date understanding of core social media platforms and how they are used to tell stories, sell products, and navigate crises
- Excellent writing and communication skills - both externally to our social audiences and internally across the company
- Extremely detail-oriented and organized
- Experience with rapid response strategies - for general engagement with the community and for navigating crises 
- Ability to learn to use GitLab as our project management and execution tool for all work (Don't worry, this comes with time. Be open to learning.)
- BONUS: A passion and strong understanding of the industry and our mission

### You must share our [values](/handbook/values/) and work under those values
_A sample of how GitLab's core values show up in Social Marketing:_
##### ü§ù Collaboration

Across teams and functions as well as externally with customers, followers, and partners. We are not islands to ourselves and lean on each other to deliver on our work. Do everything as kindly as possible. It's also critical to assume positive intent when working with team members that don't work in social media.

##### üìà Results

Make a difference in the hours you planned to work and then do it again next week. Use GitLab to manage your work. Own everything you touch and create a bias for action in social media marketing.

##### ‚è±Ô∏è Efficiency

Go for the boring solutions when we can't recreate the wheel. Search for the answers you seek in our handbook first. Build repeatable projects in a way that lets others service themselves in the next round.

##### üåê Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging

Be comfortable or willing to get comfortable with communication with team members asynchronously. Find a way to include your quirkiness in your work. Consider inclusive language and imagery in everything we promote internally and externally.

##### üë£ Iteration

Don't wait to contribute. Just make a change today. Make progress for our work in minimum viable changes consistently. Remember that all of our work is in draft. We don't do big reveals at GitLab, so be ready to share your rough drafts with everyone throughout the process (This is scary for social marketers, but our team is prepared to help you grow into this practice.)

##### üëÅÔ∏è Transparency

Everything is public by default, including our typos, bad takes, and iterations. We strive to be transparent as often and as clearly as possible with each other and our community. Always share the _why_ and not just the what. We're practitioners and educators.
