## Specialties


### Growth

The Growth team at GitLab focuses on unlocking the value of GitLab for as many customers and potential customers as possible. The Growth team pays close attention to the experiences users have with buying and trialing GitLab, as well as key product experiences that a user must have with the product in order to understand the value of GitLab as a DevOps lifecycle application.

In addition to the other Product Designer responsibilities, Growth Product Designers are also expected to:

* Understand the Growth team's KPIs and continuously look for high impact UX work that will meet business objectives while providing a great user experience.
* Gain familiarity with the end-to-end experience of GitLab, including a deep understanding of new and existing user journeys and a-ha moments.

## Hiring Process

Candidates for this position can expect the hiring process to follow the order below. Please keep in mind that candidates can be declined from the position at any stage of the process. To learn more about someone who may be conducting the interview, find their/their job title on our [team page](/company/team).

* Selected candidates will be invited to schedule a 30 minute [screening call](/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#screening-call) with one our Global Recruiters. In this call we will discuss your experience, understand what you are looking for in a Product Design role, talk about your work and approach to product design, discuss your compensation expectations, reasons why you want to join GitLab and answer any questions you have.
* Next, if a candidate successfully passes the screening call, candidates will be invited to schedule a 45 minute first interview with a Product Designer. In this interview, we will want you to talk through a case study in your portfolio so that we can find out about your process and understand your approach to design, your philosophy on design, and understand what you're looking for generally in a Product Designer position. This interview will also cover the more technical elements of design, so be prepared to talk about the tools and skills you use as a Designer.
* If you successfully pass the previous stage, candidates will then be invited to schedule a 1-hour interview with a Product Design Manager. In this interview, we will be looking for you to give some real insight into a problem you were solving as part of a project you've worked on. Ideally, this case study will be from a project with similar challenges, goals, or context to the type of work you'll find in the [stage group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages) you're interviewing for. It is fine for you to reuse the same case study you presented in the first interview. We'll look to understand the size and structure of the team you were a part of, the goals of the project, your low-fidelity design work, your high-fidelity design skills, how you approached research, how you synthesized research data to inform design decisions, what design standards and guidelines you worked within, and how you collaborated with a wider team.  
* Candidates will be invited to schedule a third 50-minute interview with our Product Design Director if they successfully pass the previous interview. This interview will focus on assessing your research, strategy, and design skills. The interviewer will want to understand how you have incorporated research into your work and get a feel for your understanding of the fundamentals of research and UX methodology. Be prepared to answer questions around the soft skills Product Designers need, and be prepared to talk to the interviewer about how you apply these skills in the real world.
* Finally, you will interview with a Product Manager who will focus on your ability to collaborate with Product teams and how your skills align with the needs of a specific stage group.
* Successful candidates will subsequently be made an offer via a video call or phone call.
