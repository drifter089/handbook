# UX Management Roles at GitLab

Managers in the UX department at GitLab see the team as their product. While they are credible as designers and know the details of what Product Designers work on, their time is spent hiring a world-class team and putting them in the best position to succeed. They own the delivery of UX commitments and are always looking to improve productivity. They must also coordinate across departments to accomplish collaborative goals.

## Product Design Manager

* **Research:** Identify strategic user research initiatives that span multiple stage groups (and possibly the entire product), and work with other Product Design/Research Managers to organize research efforts.
* **UX evangelism:** Communicate the value of UX to cross-functional GitLab team members, and influence the Product Managers you support to prioritize UX initiatives.
* **UX process**: Set up and manage collaborative processes within your team to ensure Product Designers and Researchers are actively working together. Make sure everyone has exposure to the work that is happening within the broader team.
* **Team building:** Hire a world-class team of Product Designers.
