## Overview of Education and Enablement

As a Solutions Architect, Technical Account Manager, or Professional Services Engineer, it is important to be continuously learning more about our product and related industry topics. This handbook page provides an dashboard of aggregated resources that we encourage you to use to get up to speed. Although we aggregated and/or developed these resources for Customer Success team members, they are generic enough that all team members and partners can benefit from the education and enablement resources that we have published here.

## Overview of GitLab Feature and Use Cases

The GitLab product is organized based on the DevOps stages. 

### DevOps Stages

If you're new to GitLab and the concept of "stages" are new to you, simply think of it as a category of related features that a customer finds value in with a **technical** narrative. The stages are organized in an infinite loop diagram to show the software development lifecycle from planning to development to release, with additional value for deployed applications with security and monitoring features. You can see a high-level overview of each stage on the [marketing page](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/). Be sure to click the `Learn More` link for each stage to see more about the features of that stage.

One of the most helpful resources for understanding what GitLab does, the features in each stage, and how well the feature works is our [Category maturity](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/) chart. This may also be informally referred to as our "lovable feature chart". 

If you understand what the stages are and want to dive deeper, you can look at the product categories handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/) for a deep-dive on each of the stages, specifically the [hierarchy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) and the [DevOps Stages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages). 

For the purposes of education and enablement, we focus on the DevOps stages that the customer sees. There are additional stages that help GitLab as a business succeed, such as the [Growth stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#growth-stage), [Fulfillment stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#fulfillment-stage), [Enablement stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#enablement-stage), and [Single Engineer Groups stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#single-engineer-groups-section). Although these are not necessarily DevOps stages, the Engineering and Product departments use the stage terminology for consistency. **You do not need to spend time learning about these stages and can search for this information later if the need arises.**

### Use Cases

The GitLab use cases help define the categories of related features with a **business value** narrative. In other words, why are customers buying GitLab and what do they think that we offer. You can read more about each of our use cases by navigating to the Product navigation menu at the top of this page or from anywhere on [about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/).
