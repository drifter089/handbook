# Ride Alongs
{:.no_toc}

Ride alongs provide Solutions Architects working across segments (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise, Public Sector) to participate in calls to learn how Solutions Architects and their customers work through aspects of technical evaluations.  The aim is to create an additional opportunity for collaboration. 

Ride alongs have a *Driver* and a *Passenger*. The driver is the one leading the call and is assigned as the primary solutions architect for the customer in a given region and segment. The passenger is the solutions architect looking to shadow the driver.

Ride alongs can be both within a passenger's current segment or region or outside of the given segment or region.
