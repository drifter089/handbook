# Solutions Architect Handbook
{:.no_toc}

Solutions Architects (SA) are the trusted advisors to GitLab prospects and customers during the presales motion, demonstrating how the GitLab application and GitLab Professional Services address common and unique business requirements. SA's add value to GitLab by providing subject matter expertise and industry experience throughout the sales process.

SA's identify and propose comprehensive solutions to complex business problems and workflow scenarios after compiling inputs from customer conversations. Desired inputs include pain points, role-based visibility concerns, opportunities for improved efficiencies, current technologies and tools, corporate initiatives, target outcomes and more. SA's also act as the technical liaison between the sales team and other groups within GitLab, engaging GitLab employees from other teams as needed in order meet the needs of the customer.

## Demo Readiness

Solutions Architects are occasionally called on at a moments notice to give a demo or join a call to show a prospect or customer specific GitLab functionality. A best practice for being prepared for these demo requests is to have a minimized browser window with various content preloaded into the browser tabs. Examples of common environments utilized are listed below. Note that accessing some of these links are only enabled for GitLab team-members.

* The [GitLab Demo Systems](/handbook/customer-success/demo-systems/) provides a catalog of demos and the sandbox infrastructure for performing demos.
* The [GitLab.org Group level](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap) clearly represents GitLab Epics, Roadmaps and cross-project issue views used for planning releases
* A [GitLab.com project](https://gitlab.com/jkrooswyk/joel-springsample/boards/579466) driven by Auto DevOps which includes a populated issue board as well as an active Merge Request is highly useful for describing value of workflow utilizing GitLab Auto DevOps for build, test, security and review
* A privately hosted [project](https://gitlab.demo.i2p.online/jkrooswyk/The-Monolith/environments) which utilizes a custom CI pipeline as well as more complex deploy environments and standard monitoring is useful for custom CI discussions and visualizing more complex environment requirements
* This [GitLab.com project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/security/security-reports/merge_requests/2) is commonly utilized specifically for security discussions
* The [production monitoring for GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/charts/gitlab/environments/190276/metrics) is useful for any discussion regarding custom and in-app monitoring
* The [production Grafana instance](https://dashboards.gitlab.com/d/000000159/ci?refresh=5m&orgId=1) showing GitLab Runner details is a great way to represent the art of the possible as it relates to monitoring and dashboards
* The GitLab [Direction](/direction) page in the Handbook is often beneficial for future-looking product vision questions and discussions about upcoming features
* A group of [golden repositories](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/demos/golden-repos) can be leveraged to show prospects repositories and pipelines more relevant to their programming languages and deploy environments
* Optional: [Integrations](/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/demo/integrations) may be loaded and ready to discuss by leveraging the standard demo environments
