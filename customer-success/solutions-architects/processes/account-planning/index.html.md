# How does an SA contribute to the Account Planning?
A rationale describing how an SA can contribute to the Account Planning is documented here in the [Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/customer-success-operations/gainsight/gainsight-gtm.html)


# Collaborating with Other Team Members
- SAs should collaborate with the SAL/TAM on a Technical Win Plan and ensure that the plan encompasses Workshops, PoVs, deep dives, etc. 
- SAs should be DRIs on the technical activities for new lands.
- SAs should own technical activities on account expansions where TAMs are not engaged. 
- SAs should collaborate with the TAMs on account expansions where deemed necessary especially where there’s a need for tier upgrade and  onboarding of new teams.
- SAs are not the DRIs of a customer’s initial account plan. By the time the opportunity reaches the Account Planning stage, basic account details should have been entered into Salesforce. Thus, the main purpose of completing the Account Profile section of the account plan,should be to capture important details about the customer or prospect, including information about the organization's business, strategic objectives, goals, motivations, competitive landscape, pertinent technology stack details, etc. The account profile should be all about the customer (not GitLab).
