**"Wherever possible, let's bring synchronicty" back to our sales and customer-facing team members and relationships**

Anytime we choose to use text-based communication, we do miss a chance to make a connection with someone - which can be critical to our personal and in this business relationships. While asynchronous communication is critical to the world and is the life-blood of our culture it can sometimes hamper our ability to clearly communicate whereas a conversation allows us to establish a relationship with the other person, a connection - to perhaps more clearly communicate.

The Commercial SA Engagement Model is intended further foster collaboration and influence even great iteration amongst and our customers. That being said going forward we'd like to engage in the following manner:

All Solutions Architect (b.k.a SA) requests are submitted via [Americas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/sa-triage-boards/commercial-triage/-/boards/1006966#) and EMEA,(link coming) triage boards and with all our SA notes and activities being logged within the active opportunities with Salesforce via Troops.ai.

**<u>Deal qualification is simply any deal that is piped at $10k and higher for consideration of Solutions Architect assignment.</u>**

All Salesforce linked active opportunities should have [MEDDPPICC](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/meddppicc/) (and required 7 methods applied) when the SA is requested and compelling events clearly defined or the issue (i.e. triage request) should have a clear statement indicating why that information isn’t available (yet) and how we can help obtain as the desired outcome.

<u>**Meeting Expectations**</u>

All meetings should be planned and have a desired outcomes (always ask, why do I want to meet? And communicate that to your SA partner) - agenda of attendees should be provided in advance; <u>failure to provide this information could delay in the scheduling or declination of a meeting request.</u>

Activities performed could be and aren't limit to things like, discovery calls, demonstrations, and Proof-of-Value engagements (b.k.a POVs) - though POV's  should  be positioned we're engagements are $25k or higher.

**Pro tip:** All POV/evaluation scope should be negotiated and vetted so we understand “why” (i.e. let’s not rush to answer let’s validate our customers needs and understand what they’re asking as this will help in providing a solution and establishing success criteria to evaluate and confirm Gitlab is this best partner for them).

*Please Note: Exceptions can and should be made via the issue commenting, mentioning both the ASM (aka Area Sales Manager as well as the Commercial SA Leader). Also too, note, that any customers looking to conduct Production and Pre-production level POVs/evals should be provided a paid engagement option.*

We understand that we do work with <u>new and existing customers</u> - so if there’s an ask that is a non-traditional "presales" activity that needs to be considered to ensure your customer's success; please raise it to the Commercial SA Leader along with your Area Sales Manager (b.k.a ASM).

***Coming soon/TBD*** - One to many synchronous sessions (internally and externally), live SA office hours and Public Webinar Demonstrations!

<u>**Asynchronous**</u>

In the spirit of supporting the sales floor and deals below 10k we’d like to continue to use our current methods of Slack and with same day SLA’s for initial response and validation of the ask with mutually agreed upon delivery on formal answers to the question posed.

*Please Note: If an exception needs to be made please copy both the ASM and Commercial Sales Leader should be needed quicker though we can’t guarantee that this will be fulfilled.*

<u>**Thing to always consider...**</u>

**Team meetings:** We hold our team meetings on Mondays (Americas) at 11am EST and Tuesdays (EMEA) 9.30am EST for an hour - our expectation is that unless we’re being asked to participate in a critical customer call that our folks attend our meetings. 1:1's with Commercial SA leaders can be more easily moved and will be but our team meetings allow us to meet together and cover organization topics.

**Focus Fridays:** We’ll also be continuing to preserve our “Focus Fridays” as this is a critical program for our Solutions Architects to focus, develop, and grow.

**Meeting Follow up/Research:** Solutions Architects need time to provide follow up information in as near real-time as possible, that said they’re encouraged to minimize “back-to-back” meeting scheduling - let’s be collaborative.
