## Tools and Resources
{:.no_toc}

Tools and resources provide infomation to help solution architects to conduct POV or workshops, respond to RFx, manage customer facing activities, support on-going product learning.

### Proof of Value (POV) Guidelines

Proof of Value (POV), formerly known as Proof of Concept, is conducted during the Technical Evaluation stage with Solutions Architects by  prospects or existing customers to assess the required capabilities based on a set of criteria and value drivers. A POV is a collaboration between GitLab and the prospective or existing customer for evaluating GitLab. Information on the POV guidelines, POV types and process can be found on the [Proof of Value (POV) Guidelines](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov) page.

### Hands-on Workshops

Hands-on GitLab workshops are interactive events which enable GitLab prospects and customers to learn more about GitLab, then apply that knowledge hands-on within a provided GitLab environment. Workshops may be executed as marketing events or run independently for specific customers. Detail information is provided on the [Hands-on Workshops](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/workshop) page.

### RFI/RFP Responses 

RFx's such as RFI and RFP are common steps in the public sector yet it may be required by enterprise customers to assess, evaluate and procure the software. Solution architects often participate in the RFP process, responding to the technical asks and solutions requirements. Information on responding to the RFx can be found on the [RFI/RFP](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/rfp) page.

### Product Releases

Solution architects have to keep up the pace of the GitLab monthly product releases to position feature sets and capabilities for the prospect and customer needs while demostrating the market leading position. 

Following links provide product release information to assist in tehnical discussions and technical evaluation.

### Useful Customer Facing Presentations

No two presentations are the same and we often find ourselves mixing and matching content tailored to our Customer's journey.  From Agile to CI/CD to Kubernetes and beyond, below are several commonly used decks rich in content to pull from.
