# Demonstrations
{:.no_toc}

## Demo Systems Overview and Specific Environments

The [Demo Systems Handbook page](/handbook/customer-success/demo-systems) provides an overview of the demo system infrastructure used for demonstrating GitLab features, value propositions, and workflows.  

See the [Environments sub-page][/handbook/customer-success-demo-systems/environments] for specific details on how to access the environments for use in your demos.

## Existing Demonstrations

There are a variety of locations for demo groups and projects today.  We are in the process of reviewing and cataloging all existing materials as part of the [FY21 Q3 OKR - Establish a well-maintained demonstration repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture-leaders/sa-initiatives/-/issues/9).  

Today, demo groups and projects are split between several distinct locations:

1. [GitLab Demo Portal Catalog Libraries](https://gitlabdemo.com/catalog/libraries) - provides demo scenarios with corresponding videos and project build out on the GitLab demo environment.  Some demo projects also have wiki pages with additional resources, such as a link to a slide presentation, demo script, and objection handling.

2. [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com) - there are a variety of groups and projects with Content
 - [GitLab Examples](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples) are used by product groups for feature validation, speed runs, demos, and feature showcasing in docs.  The [GitLab CI/CD Examples documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/) points our customers to these for their own use as well.  

 - [Guided Explorations](https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations) - has projects for a variety of topics, from language-specific feature flag examples, various DevOps patterns, pipeline tips, tricks, and hacks for windows, and more.

 - [GitLab CS Tools](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cs-tools) - group that provides projects for GitLab cs automation and migration tools

 - [Customer Success Demos](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/demos) - centralized location for demos used by Customer Success, including a set of golden repos for different application types, security demos, and more.

## Slide Decks for SA Demos
