This page covers the factors to consider for customer health, guidelines for selecting the appropriate rating, communication guidelines, CSM responsibilities and instructions for the account triage issue creation.

## CSM Responsibilities

The CSM is responsible for coordinating with all relevant parties to develop a plan to address the risks. Typically, this will involve the account team and communication group ([Communication Guidelines](/handbook/customer-success/csm/health-score-triage/#communication-guidelines)), as well as other relevant stakeholders such as Product Managers, marketing, executive, or engineering team members to develop and deliver the plan to address the risks. The CSM then drives execution of the strategy and is responsible for logging regular updates. When the risks have been addressed bringing the customer to a healthy / green status, the account team can agree to move the account out of triage.

### Gainsight Responsibilities

CSMs are responsible for keeping Gainsight up to date regarding all of their renewals.

**Timeline Entries**
- For at-risk renewals occurring this fiscal quarter and next, update Timeline with an At-Risk Update on a **weekly** basis with progress towards risk mitigation over the past week and plans for the upcoming week
- For at-risk renewals occurring beyond next fiscal quarter, update Timeline with an At-Risk Update on a **monthly** basis with progress towards risk mitigation over the past month and plans for the upcoming month

For those customers not at risk, CSMs should be ensuring they still update CSM Sentiment on at least a quarterly basis to avoid the [score going stale](/handbook/customer-success/csm/health-score-triage/#clearing-stale-health-measures).

**At-Risk CTAs**

CSMs are responsible for managing the CTA for all at-risk accounts including:
- Create an at-risk CTA as soon as the risk is identified, using the appropriate playbook
   - `At-Risk` is the generic playbook that is applicable for most situations, but CSMs can select more specific playbooks relevant to the risk type
- In the CTA, update the `Risk Reason`
   - By default, the CTA will have `Other Risk Reason`; this needs to be changed to the appropriate reason why the customer is at risk, for example, do they not find value in our product, have they lost budget via layoffs, are we not engaged with them, etc.
- In the CTA, update the `Risk Impact`
   - This field does not appear when opening the CTA, and CSMs need to click back into the CTA details after creation to update it
- In the CTA, update `Stage Name` and `Competitor` fields if applicable

### Mitigation Strategies

See the [Risk Types, Discovery & Mitigation Strategies](/handbook/customer-success/csm/risk-mitigation) page.

## Customer Health Categories and Risks

Health primarily considers the business impact to GitLab by evaluating the delivery of value and outcomes to customers. The following guideline will provide Customer Success Managers (CSMs) guidance to choose the right health assessment for their customer account. The following are the categories to assess and associated risks with each.

1. **Product adoption and utilization**: There is a delayed, low, or materially reduced usage (i.e., drop in usage) as measured by license usage, features / use cases, product version (i.e., not adopting current versions - self-managed only), and/or GitLab stages. Value and outcome delivery to the customer misses expectations as defined by the customer. This may also be impacted by way the customer is using the product (i.e., processes, operations and/or policies) where the customer may not be leveraging GitLab best practices to maximize the value of the solution.
1. **Product experience**: Customer has enhancements or defect fixes that are necessary for a customer and have not been delivered. The risk is determined according to the criticality of the request, severity of the issues, and/or number of enhancements and defects. Missed expectations for feature release can also impact product experience.
1. **Customer engagement**: Customer contact(s) are not responsive, miss meetings and/or unwilling to engage in cadence calls or other engagements like [EBRs](/handbook/customer-success/csm/ebr/). This could indirectly mean the customer does not see value in the solution or the solution has been deprioritized.
1. **Executive sponsor or champion**: Sponsor or champion leaves the company, moves to a different part of the organization, and/or has reduced scope of influence.
1. **Customer sentiment**: The customer has expressed concerns and/or dissatisfaction with their experiences with GitLab (i.e., sales, professional services, support, product, etc.) through direct conversations, surveys (e.g., NPS), social media or other communication channels.
1. **Competitive threats**: Prior to or during the renewal process it is learned that competitors are in play and the result could be a downgrade or churn as the customer is considering alternatives.
1. **Other organizational factors**: The customer's business performance is materially impacted and declining. The company is acquired, merging with another company, divested or another structural change to customer's business.
