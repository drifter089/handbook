## October 2023

### AMER Time Zone Webinar

#### Holistic Approach to Securing the Development Lifecycle
##### October 24th, 2023 at 9:00-10:00AM Pacific Time / 12:00-1:00PM Eastern Time

Join this one-hour webinar to gain a better understanding of how to successfully shift security left to find and fix security flaws during development, and to do so more easily and with greater visibility and control than typical approaches can provide.

In this session, we will go over the security and compliance features that are available with your GitLab Ultimate account, including:
- How to achieve comprehensive security scanning without introducing a multitude of tools and systems that expand your attack surface.
- How to secure and protect your cloud-native applications and IaC environments within existing DevOps workflows.
- How to use a single source of truth to improve collaboration between development and security.
- How to manage all of your software vulnerabilities in one place.
- How to set up compliance pipelines to provide consistent guardrails for developers, and ensure separation of duties

#### Hands-on Workshop: Security and Compliance in GitLab
##### October 25th, 2023 at 9:00-11:00AM Pacific Time / 12:00-2:00PM Eastern Time

In this workshop we will focus on how you can secure your application with GitLab. 

We will first take a look at how to apply scanners to your CICD pipelines in a hands-on exercise so that any vulnerabilities are caught as soon as the code is committed. 

Next, we will look at compliance frameworks and pipelines to show how you can ensure no one within your development teams is cutting corners and exposing your application.

#### DevSecOps/Compliance
##### October 31st, 2023 at 9:00-10:00AM Pacific Time / 12:00-1:00PM Eastern Time

GitLab enables developers and security to work together in a single tool, allowing for proactive security or “shifting left”. This session will cover what GitLab offers, how scan results integrate seamlessly with merge requests, and how to use the Security Dashboard to manage vulnerabilities.
