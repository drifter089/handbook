#### Hands-On GitLab DevSecOps Workshop
##### September 27th, 2023 at 3:00-4:00PM Pacific Time / 6:00-7:00PM Eastern Time / 8:00-9:00AM UTC+10

In this workshop we will focus on how you can secure your application with GitLab. 

We will first take a look at how to apply scanners to your CICD pipelines in a hands-on exercise so that any vulnerabilities are caught as soon as the code is committed. 

Next, we will look at compliance frameworks and pipelines to show how you can ensure no one within your development teams is cutting corners and exposing your application.

### EMEA Time Zone Webinars

#### Hands-On GitLab CI Workshop for Jenkins Users
##### September 28th, 2023 at 11:00AM-1:00PM UTC / 12:00PM-2:00PM CEST

Join us for a hands-on GitLab CI workshop and learn how it can fit in your organization! 

We will kick things off by going over the differences between CI/CD in Jenkins and GitLab, syntax requirements, advantages to using GitLab, and how you can achieve the same outcomes in GitLab. Getting started with CI/CD in GitLab will take a lot less time than tends to be required for Jenkins, and your users can stay in a single platform. 

We will then dive into how to build simple GitLab pipelines and work up to more advanced pipeline structures and workflows, including security scanning and compliance enforcement.

#### Holistic Approach to Securing the Development Lifecycle
##### October 24th, 2023 at 9:00-10:00AM Pacific Time / 12:00-1:00PM Eastern Time

Join this one-hour webinar to gain a better understanding of how to successfully shift security left to find and fix security flaws during development, and to do so more easily and with greater visibility and control than typical approaches can provide.

In this session, we will go over the security and compliance features that are available with your GitLab Ultimate account, including:
- How to achieve comprehensive security scanning without introducing a multitude of tools and systems that expand your attack surface.
- How to secure and protect your cloud-native applications and IaC environments within existing DevOps workflows.
- How to use a single source of truth to improve collaboration between development and security.
- How to manage all of your software vulnerabilities in one place.
- How to set up compliance pipelines to provide consistent guardrails for developers, and ensure separation of duties
