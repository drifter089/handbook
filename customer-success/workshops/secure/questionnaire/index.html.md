title: "TAM Secure Workshop Discovery Questionnaire"
---

Use this questionnaire to determine what information to cover in the workshop you are conducting with your customer. This questionnaire is best used as a framework for discussion during a planning meeting, but can also be used for written discovery, though you may want to tailor it to your customer.

## Product Capabilities

Please indicate which [areas of the Secure stage](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/secure/) you would like to know more about:

- [ ] [SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [DAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/)

_As capabilities are added to the Secure Workshop materials, they will be added to this questionnaire._

## Scoping Questions

_These questions should help you understand the outcome the customer is looking for, which will help you tailor the contents of the workshop to show how Secure can achieve that outcome. In addition to these questions, please review the [discovery questions provided by the Marketing team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/usecase-gtm/devsecops/#discovery-questions) and include any of those that are relevant._

- What tool(s) are you currently using for `[Secure capability (SAST/DAST, etc.)]`?
- What is your biggest concern regarding application security and scanning?
- What would you like to change about your current security scanning process?

## Personas & Attendees

_Determine who will be attending the workshop, and what their roles are._

- Who will be the primary audience for this session?
- Have we invited members of your organization's application security team?
