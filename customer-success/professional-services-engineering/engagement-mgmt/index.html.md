The [Professional Services (PS) Engagement Manager] (https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/job-professional-services-engagement-manager/) is responsible for helping Solution Architects (SAs) and the sales team develop and gain approval for custom Statement of Works (SoWs). The process typically includes the following activities.

* An initial meeting with the SA or Customer to understand the objective and/or specific requirements
* Develop an initial Estimate based upon the Services Calculator
* Update the Estimate based upon initial feedback from the Customer and/or Sales team
* Once agreed, generate a supporting Statement of Work (SoW)
* Create a cost estimate (COGS)
* Providing clarification to the PS Director in order to obtain approval for the SoW
* Present the SoW to the account team to gain signature
* Track progress of the SoW through to signature
* Provide soft hand-off of the SOW to the Delivery team upon signature to ease transition.
