## Role of the Engagement Manager

The [Professional Services (PS) Engagement Manager] (https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/job-professional-services-engagement-manager/) is responsible for helping Solution Architects (SAs) and the sales team develop and gain approval for custom Statement of Works (SoWs). The process typically includes the following activities.

* Update the Estimate based upon initial feedback from the Customer and/or Sales team
* Once agreed, generate a supporting Statement of Work (SoW)
* Create a cost estimate (COGS)
* Providing clarification to the PS Director in order to obtain approval for the SoW
* Present the SoW to the account team to gain signature
* Track progress of the SoW through to signature

## Salesforce - Tracking Professional Services Opportunities

Tracking the overall pipeline for Professional Services and individual opportunities is important to the Professional Services team to retain visbility ensure capacity for future projects.
This importance increases as we approach the end of the financial quarter (FQ) a we typically see a spike in `Closed Won` deals at this time.

To help this visibilty, the Engagement Managers maintain a subset of fields against an opportunity under the `Professional Services` section. These fields are reviewed and updated on a regular basis to support reporting to Professional Services leadership on the current forecast:

- `Engagement Manager` - The Lead Engagement Manager supporting the opportunity
- 'EM Confidence`, this can be set as:
    - Grey (Default), meaning the EM does not have visibility or awareness of the opportunity
    - Red, meaning in the opinion of the EM this will not close won within the timeframe stated
    - Amber, meaning the EM is confident the oportunity will close won, but is not confident of the timeframe stated
    - Green, meaning the EM is condient that the opportunity will close won within the time started
- 'EM Confidence Rationale` - Context and rationale to support the `EM Confidence`
- `Scoping Issue Link` - A direct link to the supporting scoping issue
