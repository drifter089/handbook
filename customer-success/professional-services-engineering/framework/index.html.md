### Services Taxonomy 
1. **Categories**: Currently Professional Services offers two major categories of services: `Education` and `Consulting`. 
1. **Types**: Further classifying types of services help us analyze business trends, prioritize investments, and schedule delivery. Types of services are broken out for each Category of services. These service types use ubiquitous language. They should mean the same thing to the customer buyer, the account team, the Engagement Manager and the delivery team.  `Migration`, `Implementation`, and `Advisory` are examples of types of services in the `Consulting` category. `Custom` and `Standard` are types of services in the `Education` Category. 
1. **Offerings**: There can be multiple offerings in each service type. As we identify market trends, we accumulate and build more offerings per service type. For example, we have [readiness assessment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/global-practice-development/implementation/readiness-assessment/-/blob/master/README.md) and general [implementation services](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/global-practice-development/implementation/implementation-template)


### Offering maturity model

The services maturity framework provides for 5 maturity levels for offerings: planned, minimal, viable, complete and lovable.

* **Planned**: A future planned offering
* **Minimal**: The offering is defined, a vision for moving to complete exists
* **Viable**: We have delivered the offering at least once, feeding lessons learned into the completion plan. At least some marketing materials and execution plans from Complete
* **Complete**: An offering that can be consistently delivered: predictability in timing, results, and margin. 
* **Lovable**: The offering is at full maturity, positive NPS & impact on customer’s adoption of GitLab product
