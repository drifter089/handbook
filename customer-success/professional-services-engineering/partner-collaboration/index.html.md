## Why Partners?

As the sales of GitLab increase, the demand for professional services will follow suit. To meet this demand we need to have an elastic and on-demand approach. Other [software companies](https://www.atlassian.com/partners) have built out a network of services partners with this approach to scaling.

Also, channel partners can help facilitate the initial licence deal and up-selling opportuntiies with customers whom they have an ongoing relationship. 


## Partner Disambuiguation
There are different types of relationships we can have with partners and its important to outline the distinctions :point_down:. Direct vs indirect is a reference to the way the services are sold - Direct means the partner sells direct to the customer, Indirect means gitlab sells services and the partner helps with execution.

|   | Partner Indirect (Staff Augmentation)  | Partner Indirect (Project Based)  | Partner Direct |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subcontracted to GitLab?  | Yes | Yes | No |
| Access  | Slack, www-gitlab-com, GDrive  | Slack, www-gitlab-com, GDrive | Partner Portal |
| Communication w. GitLab PS | Organic (see above row)  | Organic (see above row)  | Partner Help Desk  |
| Allowed to know of other Customers of GitLab PS?  | Yes | No | No |
| Can contribute back to practice automation?  | Yes | Yes | TBD  |

### Partner Direct
GitLab PS can and should help our partners be sucessful in delivering services for their (and by extension, our) customers. We can provide guidance and stategic advice, including references to public documentation or blog posts that could help "un-stick" a partner in an engagement. If the partner needs hands-on help, however, we will need to engage with the partner via and SOW to ensure we have appropriate liability protections in place.

GitLab professional services is building out a means to field and respond to help desk questions from the channel partners who are not subcontracted with us (Jan 2021). More details to come as this process gets created.

## Partner Indirect Collaboration Guidelines
- artners (Indirect) (both flavors) should have access to any subgroup or project under [global practice development](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/global-practice-development) 
- PSEs should be maintainers responsible for MR approval and Merging new code from other PSEs and Partners (Indirect) 
- Code reviews should happen on all merge requests 
- Access to customer and PS specific Slack channels.

- For delivery work on a customer engagement:
    - Partner Indirect (Staff aug)

        - Access to the [global practice development](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/global-practice-development)  group with all automation collateral 
    - Partner Indirect (project based)

        - Access at the lowest level under [global practice development](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/global-practice-development) to complete the customer project (as appropriate)

## Collaboration by Type of Service

### Consulting
- Require discovery sessions to further define the problem space that customer is trying to solve
- Deliverable(s) for these services is
    - typically a written recommendation on how to solve the problem
    - *sometimes* proof of concept code customers can apply to their environment. 
- All code developed for these services must NOT contain any customer information so we can reuse the project for future customers without reinventing the wheel 
- [Consulting services](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/global-practice-development/consulting) should be built and maintined in the consulting directory of [global practice development](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/global-practice-development)
