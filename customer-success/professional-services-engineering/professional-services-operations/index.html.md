## Operations  

#### Time Tracking 

Accurate time tracking records of hours is essential to ensure revenue can be recognized based upon percentage completion of a project scope as outlined in a Statement of Work ("SOW"), and this data is used in the calculation of gross margin. Key points for time tracking include:

- Best practice is to record time at the end of each day. This provides the most accurate account of hours worked and when it was worked
- Each PSE is required and responsible for tracking their own hours, and submitted weekly by Friday EOD for the week worked
- If time will be worked over the weekend, time sheet should still be submitted by Friday, EOD, then a new line created on the time sheet for hours worked over the weekend
- Billable hours represent work hours that a staff member reports as being aligned to a specific SOW. The format for daily time tracking for each team member is shown below, and is reviewed weekly by PS Operations and Manager
- Hours for PTO, Holidays and Friends and Family day are no longer required to be submitted in the weekly time sheet
- Notes are required for the PS Time Tracking Creditable and PS Time Tracking Non Credit projects only, not on customer projects
  
  - PTO should be submitted in the time off feature in Mavenlink, and also follow the company guidelines, [time off process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off)
  - Holidays along with Friends and Family day are scheduled on the Mavenlink calendar
  
- Time is required to round to the nearest quarter hour, example: 
  - 15m should be .25
  - 30m should be .5
  - 45m should be .75

Professional Services has a hard quarterly close for each quarter

Our agreed schedule with finace is [Montly/ Quarterly/ Year End Time Lines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15uTHHnmIvWteYGi98BaikOVDtN99MLiVN9su-YlMMLM/edit#gid=0)

Time sheets would be submitted by the team and then approved by the project lead on the cutoff date, then an additional project lines would be added to finish out the remainder of the week, then follow the normal end of the week process


#### Project Expenses
Before making a purchase of any type or booking travel for a customer project, be sure to obtain approval from your Project Manager or Project Coordinator. The Project Manager or Project Coordinator would need to review if an expense requirement was included in the project SOW.  Once the purchase has incurred or travel expenses booked, please, be sure to follow the process outlined to be sure that expenses are accounted for in the month which incurred. 
1. Purchase incurred or travel booked
1. PSE/PM submit expense report through Expensify with PSE Project Tag and COGS as the category
1. PS Manager approves expense report in Expensify
1. PS Manager selects PS Operations as the next approver for the customer expense report
1. PS Operations then reviews the expense report and sends to Finance approval and processing
1. PS Operations then reviews the customer expense report with the assigned Project Manager
1. PS Operations then adds the expense report to the customer project and submits the billing over to Finance if the expense is billable 

The GitLab Billing Manager will pull an expense report after each month end to be sure no expenses were missed during the submission and approval process.

#### Quarterly time tracking entry and approval workflow

* All hours are submitted and approved in Mavenlink on a weekly basis
* The quarterly hours report is pulled from Mavenlink and reivewed by the PC and then provided to the PS Delivery Manager for review and approval
* A PS Delivery Manager will APPROVE the hours, create an issue and attach it to the Time Tracking Epic with the `ManagerCertifiedTimesheet` label
