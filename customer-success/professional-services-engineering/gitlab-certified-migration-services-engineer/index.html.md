## GitLab Certified Migration Services Engineer

To be able to scale the availaility of GitLab Migration Services, [GitLab Professional Services](https://about.gitlab.com/services/migration/) offers a certification process for engineers who want to deliver this service to customers. The program is currently available to GitLab team members as well as selected [GitLab Certified Services Partners](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/services/).

- Understand the differences between data stored in the git envelope vs data elements that are in a GitLab (or other SCM) Project. 
- Know how to find (from the SOW or Scoping issue) what is in and out of scope for a customer engagement. 
- Knows how to run a discovery session with a customer to validate/refine the information that was gathered during scoping.

- Know how to ask for support from the PS migration team.
