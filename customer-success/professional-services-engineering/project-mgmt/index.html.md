### Project plan
 
Each PS Engagement will include a Project Plan based on the activities outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) and/or other discussions between the GitLab Professional Services and the customer.  The Project Plan may include a Gantt chart, tasks list via spreadsheet, or another form of documented plan. This plan will follow the process listed above.
 
Each PS engagement will have a Google Sheet that shows the contracted revenue and the estimated cost measured in hours or days of effort required to complete the engagement. The cost estimate must be completed prior to SOW signature and attached to the opportunity in SFDC.
 
### Project workflow
