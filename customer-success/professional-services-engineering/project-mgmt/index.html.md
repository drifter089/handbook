### Project plan
 
Each PS Engagement will include a Project Plan based on the activities outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW). The Project Plan starts in Mavenlink but may be supplemented by a more detailed Gantt chart, tasks list, or another form of documented plan. This plan will follow the process listed above.
 
### Project workflow

#### Pre-Project Prep


1. PS Operations: Once a project has moved into SFDC Phase 5 – “Negotiating”, SOW is reviewed and a PSE(s) team member is identified for the project, working with Sr. PSE and/or Technical Architect. Choice is based on several aspects:
   - PSE technical skillset/experience
   - PSE personality match with the customer
   - PSE technical growth path opportunity
   - PSE time zone
   - PSE availability
2. PS Operations: Reviews team member availability and adds a soft-allocation to the Mavenlink project schedule.
3. PS Operations: Research an appropriate Partner if it is determined that a GitLab team member is not available to work the project.
   - TODO: Link to Partner process

#### Initiate


4. PS Operations: Once a project has moved to Closed/Won in Salesforce, a project is updated to “in set-up” status in Mavenlink.
   - A Project Lead is assigned: this can be a Project Manager, or Professional Services staff member
