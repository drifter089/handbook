Gitlab takes our customer's success very seriously. In Professional Services (PS) we strive to provide a first class experience for all engagements.

### Project plan
 
Each PS Engagement will include a Project Plan compiled based on the Statement of Work (SOW) and/or other discussions the PS team has had with the customer.  This may include a Gantt chart, spreadsheet, or another form of plan.
 
Each PS engagement will have a Google Sheet that shows the contracted revenue and the estimated cost measured in hours or days of effort required to complete the engagement. The cost estimate must be completed prior to SOW signature and attached to the opportunity in SFDC.
 
### Project workflow
