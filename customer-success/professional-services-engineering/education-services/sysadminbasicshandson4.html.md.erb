## LAB 4- USING GITLAB ADMIN COMMANDS

In this section we will use 3 different commands to start/stop/restart services on your GitLab instance.

1. With your cursor in the terminal field, type: **gitlab-ctl start** and press **Enter**. 
2. Repeat this step for **gitlab- ctl stop** and **gitlab-ctl restart**
3. Review the outputs for the commands and confirm they worked appropriately.
