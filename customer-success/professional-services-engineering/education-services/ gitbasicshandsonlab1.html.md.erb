## LAB 1: CREATE A PROJECT AND ISSUE
### Create a project
1. Navigate to **Groups** > **Your groups** in the top navigation bar.
1. Expand the arrow to the left of **Training Users**. Expand the arrow to the left of the **Session** entry for your class. Click on the entry for **My Test Group** that includes your username (it should be the first entry in your class session).
1. Click the green **New project** button. Click **Create blank project**.
1. In the **Project name** field, enter `Top Level Project`. Optionally, include a few notes in the **Project description** box.
1. Under **Visibility Level**, click the radio button for **Private**.
1. Click the **Initialize repository with a README** checkbox. Click the green **Create project** button.
Note: If you do not initialize your repository with a README, you will have a “bare” Git repository that you will need to add content to in order to bring into existence.

### Create an issue
1. On the left-hand side of the screen, click the **Issues** section on the taskbar. You might need to click the double right-arrow icon at the bottom of the taskbar to make the section names visible.
1. Click the green **New issue** button.
1. In the **Title** field, type `my first issue`. Optionally, enter a comment in the **Description** field.
1. In the **Assignees** field, click the **Assign to me** link.
1. Leave all other fields at their defaults and click **Submit issue**.

### Create custom labels
1. On the left-hand side of the screen, click the **Labels** section (under the **Issues** header) on the taskbar.
1. Click the green **New label** button.
1. In the **Title** field, type `Opened` and assign it a background color of your choosing.
1. Click the green **Create label** button.
Note: this label has been created at the project level, so it is specific to that project. It will not be available at the group level.
1. Repeat these steps 2 more times, creating labels for `In Progress` and `Completed`, using label colors of your choice.
1. You should now have 3 labels created under the **Labels** section of the taskbar.

### Utilize a quick action
1. On the left-hand side of the screen, click the **Issues** section on the taskbar.
1. Click on **my first issue** to open it.
1. Below the comment field, click the **quick actions** link.
1. Review the various quick actions you can complete by using the comment field in an issue.
1. Navigate back to the GitLab page for **my first issue**.
1. In the text editor field in the comment section, type `/spend 1 h`
1. Click the green **Comment** button.
1. Notice that in the right-hand pane, the time tracking widget reflects your last action.

### Assign labels to an issue
1. Find the **Labels** section in the right-hand pane of the `my first issue` page. Click **Edit** in that section.
1. Click on each of the 3 labels you created earlier.
1. Click away from the **Labels** section, and notice all 3 labels have been assigned to this issue.
