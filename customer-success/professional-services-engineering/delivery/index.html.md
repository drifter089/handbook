This page describes key workflows for Professional Services engineers (PSEs) on the Delivery team.

### Scheduling

The Professional Services (PS) team scheduling is processed through the Sr. PS Project Coordinator (PC).  Until we roll out our PSA tool (Mavenlink), we have a spreadsheet that is our single source of record.  This spreadsheet will track all schedules of the PS team, which will include customer projects and internal work as well. 

Follow these steps to schedule a customer engagement.

To request an assignment, comment to the Sr. Professional Services PC on the project/ issue with the following details:

* Requested resource
* Dates to be worked
* Hours requested

The Sr. Professional Services PC will review the spreadsheet for availability and confirm when scheduled to the calendar.  If there is a schedule conflict the Sr. Professional Services PC will provide another set of project dates.

Scheduling updates and changes will also follow this same process with a comment on the project/ issue to the Sr. PS PC.

If a customer project has not booked, but planning/ scheduling discussions need to take place, reach out to the Sr. PS PC to review.
 
#### How to schedule internal time

Each PSE is required to add their own internal time to the spreadsheet, including the following details:

* Task name
* Hours planned

#### Weekly schedule review meetings

A weekly touch base call is held with the team to review schedules.  This type of cadence and review of the schedule will help with utilization, planning and forecasting purposes.

### Kicking off an engagement

See the details in the Project workflow section of the [PS Project Management](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/project-mgmt/) page.

### Planning and Delivering Education Services

PSEs who deliver GitLab Education Services instructor-led courses can use the following workflow to ensure smooth interactions with customers. In addition, PSEs should complete these [GitLab Certified Trainer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/gitlab-certified-trainer-process/) steps for each course they are scheduled to deliver.

#### Preparation steps

1. The Project Coordinator will contact the customer with a "Welcome to PS Email".  The email will include proposed training dates and training session planning meeting details, which will include the PSE trainer in the meeting. Trainer participation in this meeting is critical -- please let the PC (Project Coordinator) know if you need the meeting to be rescheduled to ensure your attendance.

1. Use these [email communication templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJ9q9gEzsumRxDhoWEe45u70efmKA0eWNg69WONuCYs/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure communication of the key details with the customer and training participants.

1. During the training planning meeting, be sure to discuss and document all of the event logistics listed in the [Training Event Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1huNauyfhFPvLCuo-9T7Ol3FtBDYowYxiP_T5ItP2FN4/edit?usp=sharing)
1. Add the confirmed date(s) and start/stop time(s) for each training session to the issue and @ mention the Education Practice Manager.

1. The Education Practice Manager or Project Coordinator will set up a Zoom Webinar session for each session using [these set up instructions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/remote-training-session-setup/) and add the registration link(s) to the issue. You will receive an email message with your unique link to join the Zoom Webinar session.

1. At least 3 business days prior to the training session, email the session registration link(s) to the customer, asking them to send the link(s) to each of the employees whom they want to attend the session(s). When each person registers they will receive an automated confirmation email with a Zoom Webinar join link unique to each person, along with a link to add the session to their calendar.

1. Contact the PS Instructional Designer to confirm you have the latest versions of course slides and other materials.

1. Review the train-the-trainer (T3) video for the course you are delivering

1. Review, practice, and use these [PS Remote Training Tips and Tricks](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/remote-training-tips/).

1. Complete the GitLab Training Lab set up steps below.

1. When it's time to join the Zoom Webinar session as a presenter, use the Panelist link to join the session. The Education Practice Manager will also join your session to serve as the webinar host and moderate your session for you.

##### Training lab pre-course instructor workflow

Starting in Q1FY21 PS is incorporating the [GitLab Demo Cloud](http://gitlabdemo.com/) as the standard environment for hands-on course lab activities and hands-on certification assessments. Follow these steps to set up your course attendees for lab access.

1. **Register your account**

    * Self-register at [gitlabdemo.com](http://gitlabdemo.com/) to create your credentials on the GitLab instance during the automated provisioning process. This will provide you with your own user account and organization group for your own projects. This step is not specific course session, but is a required step as a GitLab team member.

    * Credentials for your course attendees will be generated  when they redeem an invitation code that you’d provide to them. In essence, we create a unique invitation code for each course session that attendees redeem on [gitlabdemo.com](http://gitlabdemo.com/) on Day 1 of the course session, and their GitLab instance credentials are generated after they enter their code.

2. **Add your class dates**: When you have confirmed your course session dates, you will need to add them to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iVsVa5GtKkNJyipz3TQ-0NjZIOlMUr1NhflvqYUFOaM/edit?usp=sharing) and assign the provision field to the [Demo System Engineer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/demo-systems-engineer/) to start the process of creating an invitation code (same day turn around before 12pm US Pacific).

3. **Share the invitation code and access instructions with attendees**: Once the invitation code is generated, a new Slack channel is automatically created for that class for demo systems support purposes. Here is an example of the message that’s posted in the channel with the instructions for you to share with course attendees.

*Example lab instructions message*

```Invitation Redemption Code - xxxxxx
Course Title: ACME Company - CI/CD
Course Date(s): 2020-04-08
Max Redemptions: 30
Redemption End Date: 2020-04-10
Days before account expiration: 14

Instructions:
As an instructor or as a student, visit gitlabdemo.com
Click the blue button for redeeming the code above. An anonymous user account and password will be created.
Click on the red button to download your credentials (very important, don’t forget to do this since you will not be able to access this page again).
Click the blue button to access your group and create your first project.
```
#### Post-course instructor workflow

1. Download the session recordings and place them in a location where the customer can access them.

1. Create a PDF version of the slides and place it in the same location as the recording.

1. Obtain the Zoom attendee report and using the emails in the report, send a Next Steps email to all of the attendees using email template #3 located in the [email communication templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJ9q9gEzsumRxDhoWEe45u70efmKA0eWNg69WONuCYs/edit?usp=sharing).

1. <strong>For GitLab with Git Basics course instructors</strong>: When an attendee submits their certification assessment, review their work in the demo lab cloud within 7 days of the attendee's submission and manually release their results using the attendee's completed Google Form. [Here are the detailed instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/education-services/-/wikis/GitLab-Certification-Instructions) for certifying customers.

### Tracking activities 
- All Time should be recorded in an issues that roll up to the major epics.
- Best practice is to record time at the time you are working on a task.  This provides the most accurate account of hours worked and when it was worked.  
- Each PSE is required and responsible for tracking their own hours, and submitted weekly by Monday morning for the previouis week worked.  A minimum of 40, or whatever the hours worked per week is in your country.
- Issues will need to be attached to one of the Major Epic topics.

### Hours tracking- Customer Projects

Accurate time tracking records of hours is essential to ensure revenue can be recognized based upon percentage completion of a project scope as outlined in a Statement of Work ("SOW"), and this data is used in the calculation of gross margin.

Billable hours represent work hours that a staff member reports as being aligned to a specific SOW. The format for daily time tracking for each team member is shown below, and should be reviewed by the PS leadership for approval and sign-off. Rounding to the nearest hour is acceptable, and please ensure data is recorded in numeric format without the use of text strings such as "hrs".

#### Time tracking entry and approval workflow


* All Issues are attached to Epics using the [epic categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/#epic-categories) as a guide.
* [PSE Hours Report Generator](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/customer-success/professional-services-group/issue-mover/) pulls all time spent from issues that the user is either an author of, or an assignee, and creates the time tracking spreadsheet at the end of the designated fiscal quarter.
* A PS Delivery Manager will APPROVE the hours, create an issue and attach it to the Time Tracking Epic with the `ManagerCertifiedTimesheet` label
* The approving manager will submit to the Head of PS, [Sr. Director of Professional Services](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/director-of-professional-services/) for next level approval.  The Head of PS with apply judgement on productive utilization.
* Head of Professional Services will submit to the Professional Services Finance Partner for final approval.




#### Issue board

The [PS Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ps-plan/-/boards) contains everything that the group is working on, from strategic initiatives to SOW writing.

#### Labels

There are three types of project tracking labels

`Packaged` - Complete or incomplete

`Custom or standard SOW` (more than 4 working weeks) - Tracks completed percentage (25%, 50%, 75% or 100%), unless other milestones are specified in the SOW

`Embedded Engineer` (time and materials project) - Bill time and materials direct to customer

 
### How to complete a project

At the conclusion of the Statement of Work the PSE will prepare a cost vs actual analysis. This analysis will be filed in SFDC. When filed in SFDC the Professional Services Engineer will "@ mention" the Controller and Finance Business Partner, Sales in SFDC Chatter. For details see the Project workflow section of the [PS Project Management page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/project-mgmt/).
