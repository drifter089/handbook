Customer Success playbooks assist in selling, driving adoption, and ultimately delivering more value to customers via GitLab's DevOps platform. The below playbooks will include original content as well as links to other parts of the handbook.

## Structure of Playbooks

**Procedure**: Each Playbook contains the outline of steps to position, apply discovery questions, lead value discussions, and drive adoption (TAM only). The will be driven and tracked [via Gainsight](/handbook/customer-success/tam/gainsight/).

**Positioning**: Stage and use case value proposition and positioning with supporting collateral linked within Gainsight CTAs and Playbooks.

- Market requirements, personas, and differentiators
- Top features, stages, and categories
- Competitive assessments
- Customer slides
- Proof points, blogs, and customer success stories

**Discovery**: Discussion tools (e.g., discovery questions) using Command Plan approach.

**Adoption**: Adoption-related reference materials to accelerate adoption.

- Adoption map, noting recommend recommended features / use cases and sequence of adoption (where applicable)
- Product Intelligence attributes to track adoption
- Product documentation (Content owner: Product and Engineering Teams)
- Enablement and training assets

## Types of Playbooks

- **Risk**: Represents negative trends with customers. Examples include low license utilization, non-engaged customer and product risk.

- **Event/Lifecycle**: Lifecycle-based and typically scheduled events. Examples include onboarding, EBRs, and success planning.

- **Opportunity/Expansion**: Enablement/Expansion which is tied to revenue and/or product growth. Examples include stage adoption and uptiering.

- **Objectives**: Tied to Success Plans and can only be created in C360 > Success Plans section.

TAMs create playbooks to provide a prescriptive methodology to help with customer discussions around certain aspects of GitLab. We currently have a [Stage Adoption Guideline](/handbook/customer-success/tam/stage-adoption/) to assist with understanding where a customer stands, and we are working on merging adoption maps into the use case pages.
