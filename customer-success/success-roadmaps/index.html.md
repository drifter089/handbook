# Discovery Engagements

Success Roadmap discovery engagements provide customers with the benefit of GitLab's experience with DevOps methodologies, Git, GitLab, CI, CD and monitoring by brainstorming a high level, first draft discovery of the elements of a success plan to address various challenges.

### Success Roadmap design goals

- Faciliate collaboration with customers on articulating critical success factors.
- Generate rapid results through a coworked document is the final value deliverable and is considered complete by the end of the session.
- Foster efficiency by being completable in a single 60 minute facilitated, presales working session.
- To be efficient by starting with an outlined template.
- To enable diversity and inclusivity by using an open collaboration event to build out the deliverable.
- Foster GitLab Team Member inclusivity by including all prep and training in a single page of the template.
- Give the customer a deliverable that can be iteratively improved.
- To exhibit transparency by articulating all the things that are required for success, regardless of whether GitLab has services to offer for the items.

### Some Qualifiers

- It does not include design discussions or performance of any of the identified items.
- Generally one Success Roadmap is offered per SA customer engagement.
- Regardless of whether the customer chooses not to use professional services, the document is a high value artifact that they can develop further.
- If the customer chooses to use an applicable professional service, the engagement document will help rapidly understand the customer perspectives to scope and price the engagement. (Efficient reuse)
