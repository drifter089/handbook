## Product interacting with TAMs

If you are a Product Manager, Product Designer, UX Researcher, or UX Research Coordinator and are seeking feedback from customers, you should consult with the TAM organization, as TAMs have direct access and regular communication with customers across all regions, tiers, use cases, and industries.

To request a meeting with a customer, open an issue in the [TAM project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/tam) and use the "Product Engagement" [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/tam/-/issues/new?issue) template, filling out the appropriate fields. If you have a specific customer in mind that you'd like feedback from, please share the customer name in the issue and tag the TAM assigned if you know who it is.

The TAM team gets notified via Slack whenever a new issue is opened, and they will respond in the issue with specific customers and when they are available. If you don't receive a response within a week (allowing the TAM to review with their customers), feel free to ping the [`@timtams`](https://gitlab.com/timtams) group in the issue.
