## "Stage Enablement & Stage Expansion: The Two Stage Enablement Motions"

### Why does stage enablement & expansion matter?

GitLabâ€™s primary point of differentiation is our [single application](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/single-application/) approach. As we continue to drive value in any given stage or category, our first instinct should be to connect that feature or product experience to other parts of the GitLab product. These cross-stage connections will drive differentiated customer value, and will be impossible for point product competitors to imitate.  

Our [mission as a customer success team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/#mission-statement) is to create value for our customers. As a customer adopts additional [DevOps stages](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/) with GitLab, they see an increased return-on-investment (ROI). They receive this increased ROI by [increasing operational efficiencies, delivering better products faster, and reducing security and compliance risk](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/#customer-value-drivers). 

### What is the difference between stage enablement & stage expansion?

For the TAM team in driving stage enablement, there are two critical motions: 
1. Stage Enablement: Enabling on the stages a customer expresses readiness to expand into (creating quick time to value, overcoming technical roadblocks, and ensuring stickiness)
1. Stage Expansion: Driving expansion into new stages as a part of an account planning motion in-line with the SAL or AE, as a means of ensuring the customer receives increasing ROI, creating happy customers that grow. This motion starts with a discovery process to open the door to a more in-depth discovery, with demos and [workshops](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/#customer-workshops) that drive to the 'yes'. The latter part of an expansion play is the enablement of the stage, as articulated above.

### Where do I track the stage enablement and expansion?

1. The Stage Enablement (agreed with the customer) is tracked with the relevant stage enablement CTA/playbook in the [ROI success plan](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/tam/success-plans/#roi-success-plan) in Gainsight, selecting "Stage enablement" in the `Category` field.
1. The Stage Expansion (account planning & growth strategy, not yet shared by customer) is tracked with the relevant stage enablement CTA/playbook in the 'Expansion ([internal only](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/tam/success-plans/#internal-success-plan)) Success Plan in Gainsight.

### Why is there only one CTA/playbook in Gainsight per stage instead of one for adopt and one for expand?

1. We're trying to avoid playbook overload! The guidance to the TAMs is that discovery questions will still be relevant in a stage enablement/enablement motion but will be more focused on understanding the 'why' for the change to ensure we can capture the metrics for success. Workshops and demos will also often be relevant to drive deeper enablement with key users and influencers. TAMs are also encouraged to customize the playbooks to be relevant and helpful for their and their customers' needs.

### When do I open a CTA/playbook?

1. Stage Expansion: open the playbook when you plan to **start** the motion of exploring this expansion with the customer through the discovery process.  This timing is incredibly key as capturing the 'no' reasons is very impactful for articulating through data the roadblocks to expansion we see and building scaleable plays for overcoming these roadblocks. 
1. Stage Enablement: open the playbook when the customer is ready to begin the process of adopting the stage (vs when they say they intend to at a later time)
