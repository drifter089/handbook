## Taking PTO

As part of GitLab's [paid time off policy](/handbook/paid-time-off/), team members are encouraged to take time off. However, as customer-facing team members, this can feel difficult, so this page is intended to help guide TAMs to ensure they can regularly take time off, avoid burnout, and keep their customers successful.

## Before you go

To take PTO, please follow the guidelines in the [PTO policy](/handbook/paid-time-off/) and be sure to enter your time off in PTO Roots.

Before your PTO begins, please follow these additional guidelines:

1. [Establish coverage](#establish-coverage) for when you'll be out.
1. Set up your email auto-responder and include the contact information of who will be [covering](#establish-coverage) for you while you're out.
1. At least 1 cadence call prior to your PTO, let your customers know you'll be out and who will be covering for them.
1. If a cadence call falls during your PTO, you can decide to either cancel or reschedule. If there is an emergency or the call cannot be moved, the people covering for you should lead the call. It is the TAM's responsibility to prep in advance whomever will lead the call.
1. Review our [PTO communication guidelines](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off).

### Establish Coverage

When a TAM is out of office, they can rely on their SALs/AEs and/or SAs to lead customer meetings or respond to requests. Make sure your account teams know in advance that you'll be out and for how long so they can be prepared.

You can also ask [another TAM](#backup-tams) to cover for you as well, but they likely don't have the same context as the account team, so you'll need to brief them on any important initiatives.

For any specific customer needs (escalating tickets, logging issues, etc.), the TAM should rely on either the SA or backup TAM, and higher-level or sales-related items should be handled by the SAL/AE.

Be sure to confirm with whoever will be covering for you the dates you'll be out to ensure they don't also have PTO scheduled or other conflicts. Then, add them and their coverage responsibilities into PTO Roots.

#### Backup TAMs

Backup TAMs should not be expected to support the entire book of business of the vacationing TAM; however, they should stay abreast of what is going on with those accounts during the coverage period. For example, you should respond to any customers that reach out to you, but it's also recommended to spend 5 minutes each day of coverage checking if the TAM has been pinged in either Slack or in GitLab.com [collaboration projects](/handbook/customer-success/tam/engagement/). Here are some tips on how to do this quickly and easily:

Slack:
1. Use the search bar and search the person's name, then review any pings they may have gotten and answer appropriately.  
1. Alternatively, to automatically be notified if the TAM is pinged, click on `GitLab` at the top left of your Slack, go to `Preferences`, and enter the TAM's Slack handle in the `My keywords` box. (Remember to remove this when they return!)

GitLab.com:
1. To see what pings the TAM has received, go to GitLab.com and in the search bar search the TAM's GitLab handle.
1. Then, filter by issues and sort by descending creation date and review any new issues.
1. If you're familiar with what accounts the TAM has, you can also go to the region's [collaboration project group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management), go to the issue list, sort by descending creation date, and review if any new issues have been opened in their customers' projects. This is useful to catch things if the customer does not tag the TAM but is not an expectation.

Please note that while any simple questions or requests should be answered when possible, if it's more complicated or will require more work than you are able to do, please still comment in response to the customer letting them know that their TAM is on PTO and will return on X date. This way, the customer has an update and an idea of when they might expect an answer. This is especially helpful on GitLab.com as there is no native out of office responder.

PTO Roots will ping you the day before the TAM returns. Be sure to let the TAM know about any requests or situations that occurred when they return so they can follow up, as well as any actions you took while they were out.

#### Americas East PTO Buddy Program

As of July 2021, the Americas East TAM team is trialing a program where each TAM is paired with another TAM to be each other's regular PTO backup. The goal of this program is to allow the TAM's customers to become familiar with the backup TAM so they feel like they can rely on them, as well as to allow the backup TAM to become familiar with the customers so they can better cover any ongoing or new initiatives.

Additionally, it removes the uncertainty of having to ask the wider team if anyone is available to cover for them. It will also allow SAs to focus on SA work, as they should typically only be involved in pre-sales motions, and as such they may not even have more background on current customer initiatives than a backup TAM would.

Hopefully as an additional benefit, TAMs will have more exposure to how other team members work and what challenges and initiatives customers have, which will improve our team's efficiency and diversity of thought.

As the East team continues to trial this program, they will share feedback and insights to the wider TAM organization.
