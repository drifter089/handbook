A key part of the customer relationship lifecycle is the renewal phase.  TAMs must proactively track the renewal dates of their customers and align with their Strategic Account Manager (SAL) or Account Executive (AE)  to ensure that a customer renewal takes place.

## Timeframe

Four months before the renewal date for a customer, a CTA will trigger in Gainsight, prompting the TAM to reach out to their aligned account team to discuss strategy and next steps for the renewal.  As part of this process, it will often be decided that the TAM will ask the ['soft'](https://www.mbaskool.com/business-concepts/marketing-and-strategy-terms/7214-soft-fact-questions.html) question around the renewal to see if there is any risk in the account and to provide time to mitigate any risk.  The expectation is that the team will meet internally and speak with the customer regarding the renewal within 30 days, leaving 90 days to run the renewal process.

## Renewal Review Meeting

A “Renewal Review” meeting should have the following attendees:

- Strategic Account Leader
- Technical Account Manager
- Solutions Architect (if an upsell is being discussed)


The agenda of a “Renewal Review” meeting should include at least the following:

 1. Review of the customer's business objectives as documented in the success plan, and progress/completion of these goals
 1. Review of the customer health score and any changes over the past few months - changes can be seen in the Timeline in Gainsight.
 1. Review of support issues and the underlying reasons for any escalations.
 1. Review of high priority feature requests.
 1. Review of the customer's utilization of the product.
 1. Review of any known risk in the account

From this meeting a set of action items should be created to improve customer utilization and satisfaction with the product.  These items can include:

 1. **Architecture review** with Professional Services to address any underlying architectural weaknesses that could have contributed to an “Urgent” support escalation.
 1. **Product utilization review** to explore GitLab functionally that the customer is not using but could benefit from.
 1. **Roadmap review** to show the customer features that will be added to the product in the near term that may be valuable to them.  This could include a discussion with Product Management for strategic customers.

## Customer Cadence

The action items created from the “Renewal Review” meeting should be incorporated into the TAM customer cadence meetings and into any pending QBRs. The TAM should prioritize these reviews early in the renewal horizon.
