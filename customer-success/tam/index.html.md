## What is a Technical Account Manager (TAM)?

GitLab's Technical Account Managers serve as trusted advisors to GitLab customers. They offer guidance, planning and oversight during the technical deployment and implementation process. They fill a unique space in the overall service lifecycle and customer journey and actively bind together sales, solution architects, customer stakeholders, product management, Professional Services Engineers and support.

See the [Technical Account Manager role description](/job-families/sales/technical-account-manager/) for further information.

### Advocacy

A Technical Account Manager is an advocate for both the customer and GitLab. They act on behalf of customers serving as a feedback channel to development and shaping of the product. In good balance, they also advocate on behalf of GitLab to champion capabilities and features that will improve quality, increase efficiency and realize new value for our customer base.

#### Management

Technical Account Managers maintain the relationships between the customers and GitLab. Making sure that everyone is working towards pre-defined goals and objectives.

#### Growth

Technical Account Managers help to bring GitLab to all aspects of your company, not just software development. They can do this by showing other business unit's how to use GitLab for their day-to-day tasks and to advocate for new features and functionality that are in demand by other groups.

#### Success

Technical Account Managers make sure that the adoption of GitLab is successful at your company through planning, implementation, adoption and training.


## Responsibilities and Services

#### Book of Business

Technical Account Managers are responsible for managing a portfolio of customer accounts based on the sum of the annual contract value of the accounts under management. The current targets per TAM based on segment are:

- Large / Enterprise: $3.25M/TAM
- Commercial: $4M/TAM
- SMB: N/A as it's digitally-led

The team continues to drive efficiency improvements to allow TAMs to effectively manage a larger book of business.

Customers who have an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $50k or more are assigned a designated TAM, and we are piloting a customer onboarding program for customers in the Commercial segment that have an ARR of $20-50k. We are rolling out our digital enablement program, with a view to enable all paying >20k ARR customers with digital content in FY22.


There are various services a Technical Account Manager will provide to ensure that customers get the best value possible out of their relationship with GitLab and their utilisation of GitLab's products and services. These services include, but are not limited to:

## Relationship Management

### Book of Business Prioritization

On the Gainsight Attributes section, the TAM can set the priority level per customer with levels 1-3, with 1 being the highest. Definitions include:

1. High Touch: TAM-led onboarding, regular cadence calls, full TAM-led customer lifecycle
1. Medium Touch: TAM-led onboarding, quarterly check-ins, renewal touch point
1. Digital Touch: No direct TAM involvement, onboarding and enablement driven by email-led digital journey

Why do we use a prioritization system?

- Use in SALSATAM meetings to ensure team alignment
- Managers have more visibility into the potential workload of the team member via more context on the makeup of the overall portfolio
- TAMs have more insight into their portfolio and where they should be spending their time
- TAMs can run associated campaigns of education to low touch or less engaged customers or strategic (high touch) customers to be automatically invited to Customer Advisory Boards or events
- Used to further segment customers, beyond the [Sales Segmentation](/handbook/business-ops/resources/#segmentation)

Criteria to apply includes:

- Future account growth
- Size of the account
- Risk / health of account

The `TAM Portfolio` Dashboard is used to help highlight and review each client, including their priority level.
