To learn how GitLab TAMs approach customer engagement and planning conversations, a new team member shadows an established, more senior member of the team in a variety of meetings and actions taken related to those meetings.

## Cadence calls

The [cadence call](/handbook/customer-success/tam/cadence-calls/) is a core element of the TAM's engagement with a customer. There are several elements involved in a cadence call beyond the call itself.

### Pre-call prep

It's important to prep for any customer calls in advance to ensure everyone is getting full value out of the synchronous time. To shadow pre-call prep, it involves both shadowing internal calls and shadowing TAMs 1:1 while they prepare.

- SALSATAM call
  - TAMs [meet regularly with each of their SAL/AE and SA teams](/handbook/customer-success/account-team/#account-team-meeting) to ensure they are in sync on their efforts to turn prospects into customers, and engagemnt with existing customers. A new team member will shadow account team meetings to learn about how they should be conducted.
- Creating [meeting agenda](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/tam/cadence-calls/#cadence-call-notes)
- Gathering required information for call (issue follow-ups, creating demos, reviewing gaps in Gainsight entries, etc.)
- Creating calendar invite (if needed)

### Customer call

A new team member will shadow cadence calls to learn how we conduct them live.

- Walking through agenda items
- Taking notes
  - The new TAM should take their own notes during the call, paying particular attention to follow-up items, business outcomes and other customer-stated goals and problems to solve, and questions or topics they're unsure of how to address themselves
  - The new TAM should debrief with the established TAM afterward to compare notes
- Answering questions
- Discuss open issues
- Any other items to touch on

### Post-call work

After a customer call ends, there are a number of follow-up items that the TAM does to ensure any action items or unresolved questions are addressed. The new team member should shadow any internal calls and shadow TAMs 1:1 while they do this work. The established TAM should be sure to copy and/or tag the new TAM on any correspondence they have in email, issues, or Slack to ensure the new TAM sees the full lifecycle.

- SALSATAM call and/or ad-hoc debrief
- [Gainsight](/handbook/customer-success/tam/gainsight/) entries (logging the call, updating CTAs, etc.)
- Gather items on areas you could not answer on the call
  - Create issues (if needed)
  - Talk to PMs (if needed)
  - Ask questions in Slack (if needed)
- Follow up with the customer on outstanding items

The [cadence call](/handbook/customer-success/tam/cadence-calls/) is a core element of the TAM's engagement with a customer. A new team member will shadow cadence calls to learn how we conduct them, and will be involved in the pre-call planning and post-call actions.

## Account team meetings

TAMs [meet regularly with each of their SAL/AE and SA teams](/handbook/customer-success/account-team/#account-team-meeting) to ensure they are in sync on their efforts to turn prospects into customers, and engagemnt with existing customers. A new team member will shadow account team meetings to learn about how they should be conducted.
