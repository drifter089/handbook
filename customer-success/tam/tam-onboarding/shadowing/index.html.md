To learn how GitLab TAMs approach customer engagement and planning conversations, a new team member shadows an established, more senior member of the team in a variety of meetings and actions taken related to those meetings.

## Cadence calls

The [cadence call](/handbook/customer-success/tam/cadence-calls/) is a core element of the TAM's engagement with a customer. A new team member will shadow cadence calls to learn how we conduct them, and will be involved in the pre-call planning and post-call actions.

## Account team meetings

TAMs [meet regularly with each of their SAL/AE and SA teams](/handbook/customer-success/account-team/#account-team-meeting) to ensure they are in sync on their efforts to turn prospects into customers, and engagemnt with existing customers. A new team member will shadow account team meetings to learn about how they should be conducted.
