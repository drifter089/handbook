### What's a Community of Practice?

Communities of Practice are self-organized, cross-functional groups of _Subject Matter Experts_ (or aspiring to be!) within the CS organization dedicated to a topic within GitLab or the broader DevOps space. The goal is to build assets, best practices, demonstrations, and share experiences we learn from prospects and customers. In turn, CoP will build broader technical depth within our CS organization to better advise our customers and influence our product roadmap.

The content and assets are [aggregated into a single group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/communities-of-practice) to maximize discoverability. Each Community of Practice has a project which contains a Readme of links and an issue board for discussion.

| Contributor           | Any Team member who engages with the CoP group SME should try to contribute back - such as providing a deck or recording where the information gathered was utilized.     |

#### Guidelines

* CoP should consist of three or more members to foster a culture of collaboration.
* Time commitment can vary depending on involvement, but the expectation is 3-5 hours a month for active members. 
* CoP can be managed through Async communication, but the core team should meet once a month to ensure content is maintained and updated.

### Process

1. Establish a topic to build a community of practice.
2. Enlist GitLab team members to participate in your new CoP, utilize the #customer-success channel in Slack to reach a broad audience. Make sure to point them to the process outlined on this page, so they understand the commitment.
3. Create a project in the [Communities of Practice group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/communities-of-practice) by using this [project template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/communities-of-practice/project-template)
4. Setup a monthly Cadence call with the team members
5. Create and manage the [README.md](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/communities-of-practice/project-template/-/blob/master/README.md)
6. Update this handbook page under the table "Active Communities of Practice."
7. Setup a slack channel using the `#cp_` prefix so team members know where to go for help.
