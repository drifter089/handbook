# GitLab Partner Bootcamp

GitLab Partner Bootcamp is here to help you get up to speed on implementing GitLab for your customers.

It is designed to be a self paced training where you can learn about and practice most common usecases and scenarios.

Bootcamp material is divided into sections:
1. Introduction to GitLab
2. Using GitLab
3. Implementing & Operating GitLab (coming soon)

These sections are independent, so you can take any of them in any order depending on your needs.

If at any time you feel like you need our assistance, [file an issue here](https://gitlab.com/technical-bootcamp/help-me).

## Introduction to GitLab
GitLab is a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. To see what GitLab does have a look at this demo video.

## Using GitLab

### How to start?

1. You will need a GitLab site available to run this bootcamp. If you do not have private site available, use [GitLab.com](https://www.gitlab.com)
2. Create a new [Group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/) and name it Bootcamp 
3. You will need an exact copy of [this project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/channel/technical-bootcamps/using-gitlab) including issues *in your bootcamp group*. The easiest way to do this is to grab the [latest export](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-QvQLYsqTWPAiD_C-6N379cCttES86H/view?usp=sharing) and import it.
4. Labs take advantage of paid tier features, to get the full experience your instance of GitLab should be licensed to Ultimate/Gold.

5. Have a look at the issues. Pick the one named *Lab 0* and assign it to yourself. It contains all steps needed to set up the environment. Execute all tasks in it
6. Read on
