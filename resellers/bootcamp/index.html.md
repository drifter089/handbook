# GitLab Partner Bootcamp

GitLab Partner Bootcamp is here to help you get up to speed on implementing GitLab for your customers.

It is designed to be a self paced training where you can learn about and practice most common usecases and scenarios.

Bootcamp material is divided into sections:
1. Introduction to GitLab
2. Using GitLab
3. Implementing & Operating GitLab (coming soon)

These sections are independent, so you can take any of them in any order depending on your needs.

If at any time you feel like you need our assistance, [file an issue here](https://gitlab.com/technical-bootcamp/help-me).

## Introduction to GitLab
GitLab is a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. To see what GitLab does have a look at this demo video.

## Using GitLab

### How to start?

1. You will require access to a GitLab instance to run this bootcamp. If you do not have a private instance available, use [GitLab.com](https://www.gitlab.com)
2. The Bootcamp Labs take advantage of paid Enterprise tier features; to get the full experience your instance of GitLab, or your Group if using GitLab.com, should be licensed to Ultimate/Gold
    * [Get a trial here](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/). 
3. Once you have an instance of GitLab available, create a new [Group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/) and name it **Bootcamp** 
    * If using gitlab.com, make sure this is created within a Gold-tier group
4. The Lab exercises are defined as individual GitLab issues within a GitLab project;  You will need an exact copy of [this project](https://gitlab.com/technical-bootcamp/using-gitlab), including issues, **in your bootcamp group**. The easiest way to do this is to import the [latest export of the project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/195xB0wbQzYOkOZ3EVJnyJGCBNLo6azzi/view?usp=sharing)
    * Refer to the [Import documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html#importing-the-project) if required
5. Many of the Lab exercises utilise a simple **Coffee Shop** application;  Similar to the above, you need an exact copy of [the Coffee Shop project](https://gitlab.com/technical-bootcamp/gitlab-coffee-shop) which can be imported from the latest [project export](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K3l4karDEWeZvqY7qbpeo91ufbd0Cz3u/view?usp=sharing).  The project should be imported within your **Bootcamp** group, alongside the Lab Exercises project


6. Having completed the above, move to the next section on Agile Project Management. This will help you with the knowledge required to then configure your Bootcamp Lab environment


### Agile Project Management

**Now go to your imported Labs project, find the issue called *Lab 0* and assign it to yourself. It contains all steps needed to set up the environment for the future labs. Execute all tasks in the issue.**


If you are interested in market positioning, typical pain points and the way GitLab addresses them, customer stories and analyst coverage, review [additional material related to this usecase](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/usecase-gtm/agile/).

### Continuous Delivery

There is one significant usecase missing from our list. We will have a dedicated labs in the next part related to implementing GitLab. Meanwhile see [additional material](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/usecase-gtm/cd/).
