# GitLab Partner Bootcamp

GitLab Partner Bootcamp is here to help you get up to speed on implementing GitLab for your customers.

It is designed to be a self paced training where you can learn about and practice most common usecases and scenarios.

Bootcamp material is divided into sections:
1. Introduction to GitLab
2. Using GitLab
