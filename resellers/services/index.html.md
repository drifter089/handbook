# GitLab Channel Services Program

The GitLab Channel Services program is designed to help new or existing partners design service portfolios around the DevOps Lifecycle in correlation to GitLab products. The program will help partners evaluate business opportunities and create a technical enablement framework to use as they build their GitLab-related service practices. 

The foundation of the GitLab Services Program consists of two elements on which partners can build upon to start or grow their GitLab-related service portfolio:



1. Certifications:  GitLab is delivering new GitLab Certified Service Partner Badges, that include training for service delivery teams which enable partners to meet program compliance requirements. 
2. Service Development Framework:  Partners can utilize GitLab packaged service kits to assist their teams as they build the service offerings, market and sell their services, and support their service business growth. 


## GitLab Certified Service Partner Program Overview

The GitLab Certified Service Partner Program offers our Partners three Certifications:

<br>We have designed the GitLab Certified Service Partner Program to help partners who focus on offering services as a key foundation in their business model. These services can include:  



*   Implementation 
*   Migration 
*   Assessments & Audits
*   Infrastructure as Code/GitOps
*   DevSecOps 
*   Optimization & Transformation

Becoming an authorized GitLab partner is the first step to becoming a Certified Service Partner and allows you to engage with the GitLab sales team and resell or refer GitLab products to your customers. Partners can achieve the GitLab Service Partner Program badges in addition to their program status to differentiate through their service offerings and unlock both financial and non-financial incentives as they achieve Certified Service Partner Badges.

Whether you are a new partner just getting started with a service portfolio or you already have a thriving service business that you are looking to grow through offering services around GitLab, our Certified Service Partner Program will offer you opportunities to build a successful business with GitLab.
## GitLab Certified Service Partner Requirements

The GitLab Certified Service Partner framework is designed to give partners multiple paths to success by focusing on the service priorities that are aligned to their individual business model. 

Partners can achieve multiple certifications or focus on one category based on their chosen areas of focus and investment choices.

## GitLab Certified Service Partner Requirements and Progression

At GitLab, Certified Service Partner Certifications are meant to recognize service delivery excellence, technical expertise, and customer success among our partners for GitLab use cases in the DevOps lifecycle. Achieving a GitLab Service Partner Badge allows you to enhance your service capabilities and unlock key partner benefits in our Program.

<br>
<h2>Becoming a Certified Service Partner</h2>

All GitLab Certified Service Partner tracks have program compliance and training requirements that must be completed before you can obtain the associated certification.

When the contractual requirements are met, and your organization sponsors the required number of practitioners who complete the training requirements and obtain the associated badges, your company will earn the related GitLab Service Partner Certification. 

The GitLab Channel team will communicate the award in email, and reflect the certification in the GitLab Partner Locator.

<h3>Sales Acceleration</h3>

All authorized GitLab partners are eligible for co-selling with the GitLab Sales team. Certified partners are often prioritized in co-selling activities because those partners are able to deliver greater value for our joint customers. The GitLab Sales team and partner sellers align to drive customer value through joint account planning, account development, and working together to grow revenue.  Additionally, Certified Service Partners can be brought in for services only opportunities to help customers assess their DevOps infrastructure in advance of a potential GitLab purchase, or optimize their GitLab deployments.

<h2>Maintaining Service Partner Certifications</h2>

At GitLab, collaboration and feedback is meant to nurture and mentor our certified service partners to grow their service capabilities and expertise. The program will utilize our internal [customer success metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/vision/#measurement-and-kpis) to measure and understand the GitLab customer experience across the entire ecosystem and help further develop our certified service partners. In order to work together in this process, we will ask you to provide context to the annual customer success report for your customer set one month before it is due to be published. 

GitLab Channel Partner program will review the GitLab Certified Service Partners’ customer success rating and practitioner certification status each year in the month the partner was originally granted certification. Partners will be notified with the outcome of the review and the resulting status of their certification. If the partner needs to make further investments to stay in good standing with regards to Service Partner Certifications, the email will indicate the existing status and state the expected status with a deadline when compliance is required to renew your GitLab Service Partner Certification. Partners can work with their GitLab Channel Account Manager (CAM) to create a plan for obtaining and maintaining certifications.
