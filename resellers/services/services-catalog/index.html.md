# About the GitLab Partner Service Development Framework

The objective of this framework is to help new or existing GitLab partners develop service offerings around GitLab Software. The contents will help you plan and build a new practice area quickly and act as a valuable resource to help you capture new revenue.  We have included guidance for marketing and selling your services, enabling your service teams, and building client relationships through new and recurring service offerings that support longer-term engagements with your customers.

<img src=/images/channel-service-program/partner-services-virtuous-cycle.png" width="" alt="" title="Partner Services Virtuous Cycle">

To help frame the partner opportunity we would suggest partners think about services in one of four key areas that make up a robust service catalog

1. Strategic Assessments & Planning Services
2. Migration & Implementation Services
3. Training & Enablement Services
4. Optimization & Transformation Services

Offered together these services create a virtuous cycle and create the foundation for an ongoing relationship with customers of those services.
