# About the GitLab Partner Service Development Framework

The objective of this framework is to help new or existing GitLab partners develop service offerings around GitLab Software. The contents will help you plan and build a new practice area quickly and act as a valuable resource to help you capture new revenue.  We have included guidance for marketing and selling your services, enabling your service teams, and building client relationships through new and recurring service offerings that support longer-term engagements with your customers. 


# The GitLab Partner Services Offering Review

<img src="/images/channel-service-program/partner-services-virtuous-cycle.png" width="" alt="" title="Partner Services Virtuous Cycle">

To help frame the partner opportunity we would suggest partners think about services in one of four key areas that make up a robust service catalog

1. Strategic Assessments & Planning Services
2. Migration & Implementation Services
3. Training & Enablement Services
4. Optimization & Transformation Services

Offered together these services create a virtuous cycle and create the foundation for an ongoing relationship with customers of those services.

## Building Your Services Teams

In order to appropriately position your service practice in the market, GitLab suggests that partners hire marketing professionals, sales teams, and service management. Before starting your service practices you should consult with the team in your company who is responsible for market research, competitive analysis and strategic planning to set business goals and direction for your practice. This will ensure the service design, sales and delivery teams are able to focus on creating customer outcomes that will differentiate your organization in the marketplace. 

Below is a description of the functions and resources you will need to design, sell, and deliver your service offerings:
