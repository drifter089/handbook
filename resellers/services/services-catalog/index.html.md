# About the GitLab Partner Service Development Framework

The objective of this framework is to help new or existing GitLab partners develop service offerings around GitLab Software. The contents will help you plan and build a new practice area quickly and act as a valuable resource to help you capture new revenue.  We have included guidance for marketing and selling your services, enabling your service teams, and building client relationships through new and recurring service offerings that support longer-term engagements with your customers. 


# The GitLab Partner Services Offering Review

<img src="/images/channel-service-program/partner-services-virtuous-cycle.png" width="" alt="" title="Partner Services Virtuous Cycle">

To help frame the partner opportunity we would suggest partners think about services in one of four key areas that make up a robust service catalog

1. Strategic Assessments & Planning Services
2. Migration & Implementation Services
3. Training & Enablement Services
4. Optimization & Transformation Services

Offered together these services create a virtuous cycle and create the foundation for an ongoing relationship with customers of those services.

# Define Your Service Practice Starting Point 

In order to accommodate various service business models, the framework supports three different options for incorporating GitLab into your Service portfolio.

   <td>Resell
   </td>
   <td>Partners can  leverage and resell <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/services/catalog/">GitLab Professional Service SKUs</a> including both project services as well as training services or engage GitLab Professional Services to deliver custom engagements through your Channel Account Manager (CAM) and Sales Account Leader (SAL). 
   </td>

  <tr>
   <td>Professional Services
   </td>
   <td>Partners can leverage any combination of the following 3 ways to build their professional services practices:


<br>Leverage training and enablement materials and certifications from GitLab to include GitLab into their existing professional services practices.

<br>Leverage the pre-packaged services that GitLab Professional services offers as key guidelines for incorporating GitLab in your overall DevOps service portfolio integrated through unique partner developed solutions and intellectual property.

## Building Your Services Teams

In order to appropriately position your service practice in the market, GitLab suggests that partners hire marketing professionals, sales teams, and service management. Before starting your service practices you should consult with the team in your company who is responsible for market research, competitive analysis and strategic planning to set business goals and direction for your practice. This will ensure the service design, sales and delivery teams are able to focus on creating customer outcomes that will differentiate your organization in the marketplace. 

Below is a description of the functions and resources you will need to design, sell, and deliver your service offerings:

### Training Technical Resources 

For technical staff to function as change agents supporting current and emerging cloud technologies, their buy-in for the use and integration of these technologies is needed. [GitLab offers various sales, technical sales, and professional services learning paths and certifications to enable your technical team members to gain knowledge and validate their capabilities](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/training/).  

After your organization has sponsored technical resources to achieve these certifications, you can become a [GitLab Certified Services Partner](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/services/).  To learn more about which certification you need 

## Building Your Service Catalog

<img src="/images/channel-service-program/partner-services-virtuous-cycle.png" width="" alt="" title="Partner Services Virtuous Cycle">


While GitLab fundamentally changes the way Development, Security, and Ops teams collaborate and build software, the challenges that many organizations are facing require not only a class-leading DevSecOps platform but help and services from trusted service providers to maximize the benefits of that platform. 

For simplicity we group those services into a service catalog made up of four key areas which can be delivered or thought of as phases in a virtuous cycle.   

**Note**: while we have numbered the phases to align with projects where partners are beginning their relationship with a customer, there is no fixed starting point in this virtuous cycle.  For your existing customers, it is actually likely that you might be starting elsewhere in the cycle, the key is working to make sure your relationships are leading you towards a continuous level of engagement with your customers so that you can lead them through the cycle over and over again driving incremental value for the customer and solidifying you as their trusted advisor.
