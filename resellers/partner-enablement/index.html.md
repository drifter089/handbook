In this section of the Channel Partner Programs Handbook we review assets and enablement from the perspective of Channel Partners' Technical Presales constituencies.

Beyond our Channel Partners Handbook pages, you will find sales guides, use cases, training materials, and program guides reviewed below and hosted and updated in our [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/). The materials should be a great place to start effectively selling, serving and hitting your number with GitLab.

Rember that some of the links below require you to login to [GitLab's Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) first. If you haven't already, [here is where you register for portal access](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/).

# Advanced Presales & Technical Knowledge
{: .gitlab-orange}

## Compete

* [GitLab Maturity Page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/): A very transparent assessment of the maturity of each GitLab feature. No direct comparisons with other vendors here.

* [GitLab Customer Success Stories](https://about.gitlab.com/customers/): Our success stories, including customer tesimonials.

## Technical

* [GitLab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/): The best starting point for technical questions. It lists feature descriptions, excellent tutorials, and troubleshooting tips.

* [GitLab Blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/): Various content about GitLab. Mostly technical stuff, but not exclusively. Subscribing to the newsletter can be useful.

* [Release Overview Website](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/what-is-new-since/?tab=features): A fairly unknown tool that can help with understanding the changes in each GitLab version. (Source code of the website is [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/what-is-new-since).) Important features of this website to pay extra attention to:

    * [CVEs by version](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/what-is-new-since/?tab=cves): easily keep track of security vulnerabilities in each GitLab version.

    * [Upgrade path](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/toolbox/upgrade-path/): a handy tool which can list the steps of upgrading self-managed GitLab from version X to version Y.

* [Deprecations by version](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html): same data as [this page](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/what-is-new-since/?tab=deprecations) of the Release Overview website, just in a different format.

* [GitLab Releases Blog](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/): The same information as the Release Overview website, but in nicely formatted blog posts, ready to share with customers.

* [GitLab's Repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab): The source code of the GitLab software itself. The most useful part is the [Issues page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues), where everybody can check the state of a feature or a bug and see if it's planned or being worked on.
