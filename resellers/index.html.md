### INTRODUCTION:  GitLab Partner Program Overview

The GitLab Partner Program is a new kind of program.  It’s open to everyone and like our overall company culture, everyone can contribute.  Although we welcome all partners, our program is structured to provide additional rewards for partners that make a commitment and investments in a deeper GitLab relationship.


The GitLab Partner Program enables partners and potential partners — including systems integrators, cloud platform partners, independent software vendors, managed service providers, resellers, distributors and ecosystem partners — to maximize customer value through the GitLab platform and their value-added GitLab and DevOps services.  

### GitLab Value for Partners

GitLab is experiencing tremendous growth, which creates incredible opportunities for our partners.  Partners have the opportunity to create revenue growth for their companies through:

*   Product sales discounts or referral fees
*   Growing recurring revenues and renewals
*   Deployment and consulting services incentives and opportunities including implementation, integration, migration, education and process improvement services.

Open is for all Partners in DevOps space, or ItaaS and other adjacent spaces that are committed to investing in their DevOps practice buildout. Also the Open track is for Partners seeking to develop customers or just want to learn about Gitlab and participate in the Gitlab partner community.  GitLab Open Partners may or may not be transacting partners, and can earn products discounts or referral fees.
*   **Select** partners are by invitation only and are reserved for partners that make a greater investment in GitLab expertise, develop services practices around GitLab and are expected to drive greater GitLab product recurring revenues.  
*   **Technology** partners that drive GitLab solutions through product integrations and marketplaces. Technology Partners are key to completing our customer solutions through integrations with Cloud platforms, legacy DevOps solutions and other solutions needed to meet customer requirements.

### Getting Started with GitLab

To engage with GitLab, partners start by completing the online registration process on about.gitlab.com/reseller page, executing the GitLab Partner Agreement and completing the partner onboarding steps.

Once a partner contract is executed , you will have access to the GitLab Partner Portal and other members of your team will be able to register and be associated with your account.  At that time, you will be able to enter deal registrations and referral transactions.  You will also have access to sales tools, technical resources, and training courses.

### Training and Certification Program and Requirements

GitLab has developed core training and certification for sales, solution architects (pre-sales engineers), and post sales engineers and consultants.  The GitLab certification program is designed to provide our partners with similar training as GitLab employees themselves.  GitLab is announcing three certifications for the GitLab Partner Program:

1. **GitLab Sales Core** - This is the basic certification for sales and the prerequisite for pre-sales technical professionals.  The curriculum provides an overview of the market GitLab services, customer personas and needs, GitLab solutions and positioning of GitLab.  By completing the GitLab Sales Core, you’ll earn a GitLab Core Sales accreditation and meet the program requirement for Sales certification.
2. **GitLab Solution Architect Core** - This is the basic certification for pre-sales technical professionals and provides a deeper understanding of demonstrating, deploying, integrating and optimizing GitLab solutions.  This certification is a mix of online learning and hands-on labs.  GitLab Sales Core is the prerequisite for GitLab Solution Architect Core.  GitLab Solution Architect Core meets the program requirement for Pre-sales technical certification.  _NOTE:  The hand-on lab components for this certification are not yet available for partners.  Partners will be notified once it is available._
3. **GitLab Technical Core** - GitLab Technical Core is the foundational technical training for post-sales technical professionals and can also be a valuable training for pre-sales technical professionals.  As we continue to develop our services enablement offerings, partners will need to develop a custom plan with their Channel Account Managers to meet the certification requirements.

 On-demand, online training courses are available on the GitLab Partner Portal.  Registration for courses delivered to a live audience will also be available on the Partner Portal. Sales Core training takes approximately 3.5 hours to complete, Solution Architect training takes approximately 5 hours to complete. 

Upon completion of each certification program, partners will earn a badge and will address the corresponding company certification requirement.

GitLab employees can access the discount table [here.](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0694M000008xAk4)

#### Definitions and Qualifications


*   **PIO Discount** - You can earn the largest available product discount with a **Partner Initiated Opportunity**. It can be a new opportunity to our sales team or one that was significantly impacted by the partner, early in the sales cycle.  It can be for a new or existing customer.  True ups and add-on licenses at renewal can also qualify for PIO discounts. The partner is expected to assist the GitLab Sales team in closing the sale.  
This is an upfront discount and the amount depends on your track within the GitLab Partner Program. To qualify for PIO discounts, partners must submit a deal registration to GitLab via our Partner Portal, and it must be approved by GitLab Sales to qualify. PIO is available for both resale and referral opportunities.  Please visit the Deal Registration Program guideline in the Program Guide for additional details.
*   **Partner Assist Opportunity** is a discount earned for a GitLab-sourced opportunity where the partner assists our sales team in closing the deal. This may include demonstrating GitLab software, organizing executive meetings, delivery of services, etc. This is an upfront discount and the amount depends on your track within the GitLab Partner Program. To qualify for Partner Assist discounts, partners must submit a deal registration to GitLab via our Partner Portal, and it must be approved by GitLab Sales to qualify. Please visit the Deal Registration Program guideline in the Program Guide for additional details.


*   **Partner Fulfillment Opportunity** is fulfilled by a partner but closed independently by the GitLab sales team. The partner only processes the order and doesn’t provide additional support to close the deal.


*   **Services Attach Discount and Rebate** is an incentive for partner-delivered services provided to the end user related to their use of the GitLab Software (Core/Free and Starter/Bronze sales do not qualify). Services include product-related services (such as deployment, integration and migration), operational and strategic. For resale partners, the first Services Attach incentive is administered as an upfront 2.5% discount from the GitLab license price on the initial sale. Partners that do not resell or resellers that sell their own services after the initial sale may earn a rebate of 2.5% of the net license price of the most recent software sale for a period of up to six (6) months.
    *   This incentive is stackable to up to three (3) independent services engagements provided by the partner to a single end user. The maximum is 7.5% discount and/or rebate with any combination of upfront or post sales of partner-delivered services.
    *   Partner Services engagements must meet the following partner services deal size minimums:
        *    1st deal: => $7,500
        *    2nd deal: =>$10,000
        *   3rd deal: => $10,000

    Services Attach requests shall be submitted to GitLab via the Partner Portal as a deal registration, Services Attach requests shall be submitted to GitLab via the Partner Portal as a deal registration (Deal Registration Type = Services Attach), must include reasonable information and documentation (as requested by GitLab) to demonstrate the Referral Clients receipt of the Partner Professional Services and must be approved by GitLab Sales.

    Each rebate paid out quarterly, 45 days after the end of each quarter.  


*   **Referral Fees** - Referral fees are paid to partners for identifying Partner Initiated GitLab software sales opportunities that are not being resold by the partner. To qualify for a referral fee, partners must enter a referral fee deal registration in our Partner Portal. Each registration received by GitLab qualifies as a "Qualified Referral," provided that the referral is a GitLab sales opportunity that is new to GitLab, and the customer/prospect is willing to enter into a binding written agreement with GitLab to use our products and services.
    *   All referral deal registrations must be approved by GitLab before becoming eligible for a referral fee. Referral fees are paid out quarterly, 45 days after the end of each quarter.
*   **Services Resale** - Any partner-sold services delivered by the GitLab Professional Services team. Partners qualify for a program discount on services resale if the services are included on the order of a deal registered opportunity.
*   **Subscription Renewals** - At the end of their GitLab license subscription, customers must renew to continue their subscription. For customers whose most recent GitLab purchase was through a reseller partner, the incumbent reseller can earn a discount on the resale based on their program track, unless 1) the incumbent partner is no longer in compliance or 2) the customer provides a written request to GitLab to renew with a different partner.  A deal registration on the original opportunity is not required for a partner to earn incumbent status.

    In some cases, a customer purchased their most recent subscription directly from GitLab, but is directed to a partner for renewal.  GitLab has a significant install base of these customers with a high propensity for up/cross-sell and services opportunities. Partners are encouraged to engage with these customers but for now, the first renewal of a formerly direct customer will not be discounted for partners.  However, these new customers will create additional opportunities for growth through:  

    *   Upsell and expansion opportunities
    *   New integration, operational and other professional services opportunities
    *   The sale and integration of GitLab technology partner solutions
    *   Add-on sales of other non-GitLab products
    *   Subscription renewal discounts on future renewals

 ** **


### The Deal Registration Program Overview

To promote the growth and success of our channels, to manage channel conflict and provide a systematic approach to pursuing sales opportunities, GitLab has formalized our rules of engagement and deal registration procedures.

Only a properly completed Deal Registration Form can initiate an engagement. It is therefore in all parties’ best interest that you complete a Deal Registration Form as soon as a qualified sales opportunity is identified.  Since the first qualified deal registration is approved, partners are encouraged to submit their deal registrations as early as possible to lock in the biggest discount.

Deal registration and associated discounts are only available to partners that have signed the GitLab Partner Program Agreement, and for deals approved by GitLab Sales. In the GitLab Partner Program, you need to register individual sales opportunities. Partners may not register an account or combine opportunities.


*   Deal registration approval is based upon order of receipt of the registration, qualification of the opportunity, partner ability to deliver in-country/region support, partner relationship with customer.  Final deal registration approval decision will be made by GitLab Sales.
*   Only one partner can earn a deal registration discount per opportunity.  Partners, other than the partner granted the deal registration discount that request a quote, will receive the fulfillment
discount rate. 
*   New customer opportunities or new opportunities with existing customers can qualify for deal registration.  Add-on sales to renewals can qualify for deal registration.
*   Approved deal registrations have standard 90-day expiration from the date of original approval (Deal Registration extensions beyond the initial 90 days approval are at the sole discretion of GitLab).
*   GitLab collaborates with partners holding the approved deal registration and is available to support partners throughout the entire sales process.
*   In the event the engagement is dissolved, the GitLab Sales Rep will generally notify you by phone or email. GitLab will reconsider other deal registrations submitted for this deal, in chronological order of submission. If there are no other registration requests submitted, the GitLab Sales Rep will typically initiate engagement with a reseller of the GitLab Sales Rep’s choosing.

To learn how to enter a deal registration, vist the [Deal Registration Instructions](/handbook/resellers/#deal-registration-instructions) section below.

GitLab will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide rejection or Approval.

4.3. Pursuant to the “Resale Payment Table”, as set forth within the GitLab Partner Program, the amount of discount Partner is to receive may be based upon a series of criteria, including but not limited to: (i) whether, or not, the Resell Opportunity was either: (a) Partner Initiated Opportunity (PIO), (b) Fulfillment Opportunity, or (c) Partner Assist Opportunity; (ii) Partner’s status (e.g., Open or Select); (iii) Gross Sale (as defined herein); and (iv) the GitLab Products and Services sold to the End User. “Gross Sale” shall mean the annual fees paid by a Reseller, or Authorized Distributor, to GitLab for GitLab Products and Services as agreed to in an executed Order Form, or other transaction document.

##### Submitting a Deal Registration


###### Basic information

1. Go to the portal at [partners.gitlab.com](https://partners.gitlab.com/) and select Register a Deal.
2. Select type of deal registration.
3. Complete information. Ensure information is complete. GitLab will not engage based on a speculative or poorly defined opportunity, or with a reseller who is not eligible to win a sales opportunity.
    1. For Services Attach, partners must include proof of services delivered to the customer.



![alt_text](/images/Channel-Handbook1.png "image_tooltip")


4. Submit the deal.
5. Go through the review and approval process.


##### As deal registrations are received, GitLab Sales Reps:


*   Review deal registration applications
*   Advise if you are the first to register an opportunity
*   Work with you to confirm whether a deal is a qualified sales opportunity

##### How it works:

*   Only a properly completed deal registration submission can initiate an engagement and, as mentioned, engagements are not exclusive. Thus, it is in all parties’ best interest to complete a deal registration form as soon as a qualified sales opportunity is identified.
*   The GitLab Sales Rep checks to see if GitLab is already engaged with another reseller on this opportunity. If so, the Sales Rep rejects the deal registration and notifies you that we cannot engage with you.
*   If GitLab is not already engaged with another reseller, the Sales Rep or Account Executive contacts you to schedule a meeting or conference call with the customer to confirm that the following requirements are met:
    *   The information submitted on the deal registration form is complete and correct.
    *   A qualified sales opportunity exists.
    *   You are in full compliance with an appropriate and effective GitLab reseller agreement and all applicable policies/programs.
    *   The customer has not selected an alternate GitLab reseller for this deal.
    *   The customer agrees that you are eligible to win this business.
    *   Note: “Eligible” means that you meet all contractual or regulatory requirements to bid on the deal and that the customer is willing to buy you. This is particularly relevant with government contracts/bids, but could also apply to commercial work.

If any of the above requirements are not met—or you fail to promptly schedule a meeting or conference call with the customer—the GitLab Sales Rep may advise you that we cannot engage with you for this opportunity. GitLab will then reconsider other deal registration applications submitted for this deal, in order of submission. You may subsequently attempt to remedy this situation and submit another deal registration form for this deal, but this will be considered a new submission.

#### Quote to Order


##### Receive a GitLab Reseller Quote

Attached below is a sample quote. When you request a quote, you receive a document that looks very similar to this. This quote reflects your reseller price exclusive of incentive bonuses, and is not meant for the end customer. You will need to generate your own quote to the end customer.

The quote comes with a[ Sertifi](http://corp.sertifi.com/) link. E-signing the quote with Sertifi initiates the invoicing process and causes our systems to invoice you. Do not e-sign the quote until you are ready to be invoiced. Do not e-sign the quote if your customer will be paying us directly.

Note that we do not generate a quote, or fulfill an order, without an end user contact complete with email, shipping address, and postal code.

![alt_text](/images/Channel-Handbook2.png "image_tooltip")


#### License Key Delivery

Once the order is invoiced and the customer accepts the EULA, they are able to download their GitLab license key. Note that you do not receive a license key - it goes directly to the customer.


#### Remitting payment to GitLab

You can arrange for payment either via invoice, or your customer can pay us directly.


##### By Purchase Order

If your customer will be paying us via a Purchase Order, then you must email us a copy so that we may invoice the customer. Please send the Purchase Order to POfulfillment@gitlab.com for fulfillment.


##### Paying via Invoice

To pay via invoice, simply e-sign the[ reseller quote](/handbook/resellers/#gitlab-quote) to initiate an invoice, then remit payment in USD to the bank listed on your quote.


##### Execute the GitLab EULA

All orders require an executed[ EULA](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/signature.html) when there's a new subscription or an add-on. There are 2 methods of obtaining a EULA:



1. **License Key Deployment:** The default for reseller orders is that the end customer will receive a link to download their license key. The customer needs to click an acceptance of terms to get their key.
2. **Physical Signature:** Some customers may require a fully countersigned document.

An order is not complete without a signed agreement.


#### Evaluation Licenses for Prospects


*   We will issue a 30-day evaluation license for your prospects if the deal is properly[ registered](/handbook/resellers/#deal-registration).
*   We can renew this license if your customer needs more time.
*   Upon the second request for renewal (the third license), we assist you with a managed evaluation, where goals are set for the customer to meet. One of our Solutions Architects works with you and the prospect to bring them to completion before the third evaluation expires.


#### Requesting a GitLab NRF (Not-for-Resale) License  


1. Authorized GitLab Partner fills out the NFR License Request Form which can be found on the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/) on the Services Page. 
    1. Partner Help desk (PHD) reviews the request and works with the partner if additional information is needed.
    2. Once activated the requestor will receive a license key via email.

##### MDF Terms and Conditions

MDF may not be used for capital expenses or the normal cost of business.

*   Activities/expenses NOT covered under the GitLab MDF Program include: Alcohol, cash, charity event/activities, product discounts, travel and lodging expenses.
*   Activities that involve multiple vendors will not be supported at 100% funding by GitLab. The local Channel Marketing Manager may approve a percentage of funding based on the number of vendors and visibility of GitLab vs. other participating vendors.
*   GitLab reserves the right to modify or terminate the MDF Program upon 30-days advance written notice, which are provided on the GitLab Partner Portal. Such modification or termination will not affect prior approved requests for activities that ran before the effective date of the modification or termination, nor will it affect prior approved plans in progress at the time of the change.
*   If claims are not submitted within 30 calendar days following the activity, the funding allotment and/or allocation may be null and void, and you may forfeit any unallocated or unclaimed funds.
*   GitLab will only pay for the claim amount approved, not fees for wire transfer deposit or local currency deposit.
*   Lead lists provided as proof of performance will not be used by GitLab’s inside sales team to call or nurture unless without written permission from the partner, or the customer has already engaged directly with GitLab.
*   You must conduct your business and marketing operations in an ethical manner and in accordance with all applicable U.S. and international laws, ordinances, codes and regulations. You may not directly or indirectly make, authorize, offer, or promise to make or give any money, bribe, gift or anything of value to any person for the purposes of influencing that person or a family member of that person under circumstances where the payment or gift would constitute an illegal payment under the laws of the United States or any country.
*   All decisions related to program benefits and eligibility are at the sole discretion of GitLab.
*   Partners eligible for MDF must be a GitLab channel partner in good standing, with a valid and current channel partner agreement. Upon termination or expiration of the channel agreement, all in-progress MDF (even if MDF approval has been given) will be forfeited.
*   Submission of false or fraudulent claims can cause you to be ineligible for the MDF Program and may render MDF requests to be forfeited, regardless of their stage of execution.
*   You may not deduct or set off an MDF claim from any payment due to GitLab in the regular course of business with GitLab.
*   GitLab reserves the right to audit and verify all MDF claims and request additional documentation at any time. GitLab may deny any MDF claims that it believes, at its sole and absolute discretion, do not conform to these guidelines.
*   If GitLab subsequently denies an MDF claim for good cause after reimbursement, you must immediately return such funding to GitLab.
*   The terms of these MDF guidelines are in addition to the applicable channel partner agreement in place with GitLab, and are valid only when specifically referenced from the applicable channel partner agreement, program guide, or otherwise made available to a channel party by GitLab in writing. All terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning set forth in the applicable channel partner agreement.

### Technical Support

While not required, we expect customers will, for the most part, contact you if they need help. It is in both of our best interests that they do so, as the more touch points you have with them, the more likely you are to further develop business with them. We do not expect you to be as knowledgeable about our products as our own support staff, and do expect that you may need to escalate some issues to our support staff.

For pre-sales technical issues, please contact your local GitLab sales team

The GitLab team handbook is the central repository for how we run the company. Printed, it consists of over[ 5,000 pages of text](/handbook/about/#count-handbook-pages).
