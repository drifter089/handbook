## GitLab Channel Partner Program & Guide


### How the Program Works

Partner Program Tracks &  Designations

The GitLab Partner Program consists of two tracks to support the different ways our partners go to market:



* Open – This track is for all partners (resellers, integrators, sales, and services) in the DevOps space , IT as a service (ITaaS) and other adjacent spaces that are committed to investing in their DevOps practice buildout. GitLab Open partners may or may not be transacting partners, and qualifying partners can earn product discounts, referral fees and services incentives.
* Select – In this track, partners make a greater investment in GitLab sales expertise develop services practices around GitLab, and are expected to drive greater GitLab product recurring revenues. In return, Select partners have a dedicated Channel Account Manager (CAM) and greater investment. The Select track is by invitation only.
* Professional Services Partner (PSP) - this partner designation highlights your team’s capabilities in helping customers get up and running with GitLab as well as maximizing those customers’ ROI in GitLab.

### GitLab Channel Services Program

The GitLab Channel Services program is designed to help new or existing partners design service portfolios around the DevOps Lifecycle in correlation to GitLab products. The program will help partners evaluate business opportunities and create a technical enablement framework to use as they build their GitLab-related service practices.

The foundation of the GitLab Channel Services Program consists of two elements on which partners can build upon to start or grow their GitLab-related service portfolio:



1. [Designations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/services/#gitlab-certified-service-partner-program-overview): GitLab offers GitLab Service Partner Designations, that include training for service delivery teams which enable partners to meet program compliance requirements.
2. [GitLab Channel Service Packages](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/c/Services): Partners can utilize GitLab Channel Service Packages to assist their teams as they build the service offerings, market and sell their services, and support their service business growth.


#### Becoming a Service Partner

All GitLab Service Partner Designations have program compliance and training requirements that must be completed before you can obtain the associated badge.

The GitLab Channel team will communicate the award in email, and reflect the certification in the GitLab Partner Locator.

All GitLab Service Partner Badges are reviewed periodically. Non-compliant partners at the time of the review will have one quarter to return to compliance.

#### Maintaining Service Partner Badges

At GitLab, collaboration and feedback is meant to nurture and mentor our service partners to grow their service capabilities and expertise. The program will utilize our internal [customer success metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/vision/#measurement-and-kpis) to measure and understand the GitLab customer experience across the entire ecosystem and help further develop our service partners. In order to work together in this process, we will ask each service partner to provide evidence (as stated in the program descriptions above) to support the periodic review for your customer set one month before it is due.

GitLab Channel Partner program will review the GitLab Service Partners’ customer success rating and practitioner certification status each year in the month the partner was originally granted certification. Partners will be notified with the outcome of the review and the resulting status of their badge. If the partner needs to make further investments to stay in good standing with regards to Service Partner badge, the email will indicate the existing status and state the expected status with a due date when compliance is required to renew your GitLab Service Partner Badge. Partners can work with their GitLab Channel Account Manager (CAM) to create a plan for obtaining and maintaining badges.
