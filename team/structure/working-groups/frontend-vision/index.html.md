### Context

Currently, our frontend development guidelines only document features and practices _we are using currently in production_. There is no clear documentation about what do we see as a desired state of the frontend at GitLab, neither guidelines regarding practices we plan to deprecate. It would be nice to define a set of high-level expectations regarding frontend architecture, teck stack and best practices as we see them on the scope of three years from now. Here is a non-exhausting list of topics we should discuss:

- Single-Page Application vs Multi-Page Application vs hybrid approach (multiple SPA's that handle some functionality).
- Server-Side rendering
- Technical stack (frontend framework, state management approach, testing levels and tools)
- Real-time features, optimistic updates, frontend caching and "snappy GitLab experience" overall
- Exception process when certain group requires the tool that deviates from the main strategy

### Exit Criteria

This Working Group has the following goals:

1. Discuss and come to conclusion regarding the frontend vision
1. Add the documentation about frontend vision to frontend development guidelines via a set of merge requests
1. Develop and implement a communication plan for the outcomes of the working group.
1. Document the process for proposing changes to the main strategy.
