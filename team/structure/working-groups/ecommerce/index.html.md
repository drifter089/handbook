## Business Goals

E-Commerce enables GitLab to engage with customers on their terms, offering seamless self-service options.  Interacting with us is flexible, asynchronous enabled and transparent.
We deliver a best in class self-service experience for discovering & adopting GitLab, purchasing, expanding and managing your GitLab subscription.

Overall Goal
The GitLab E-Commerce Selling motion can impact our business in the following ways:

The potential to improve the trial conversion rates to increase First Order wins and future LAM captured in all segments.
The improved e-commerce potential will allow customers to self-select into a higher % of purchases without requiring a salesperson to spend time building a quote, thus allowing the sales person to spend time on higher value added activity.
Having the ability to secure the low LAM customers on longer contracts with upfront payment allows the transactions enabled by ecommerce to reduce the costs of retention or keep costs flat and increase retention.
