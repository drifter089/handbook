## Business Goals

Self-service and e-commerce are key levers to the success of our business (also now part of 12 Cross-Functional Initiatives). They drive customer satisfaction and adoption, deliver GTM efficiency, assist in channel development and ultimately, expand our revenue and improve our position in the market.

As the demands of the business grow in complexity and the areas that self-service touches increase, it will be crucial for us to align on one, common self-service strategy.

The goal of this group is to ultimately define the most effective way to deliver on self-service and bridge the gap between where we are today and our long-term vision and objectives.

_note: [Zuora SSOT](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4664) is a prerequisite of any system changes coming out of this working group. Following through on this work enables us to scale and iterate more efficiently, even if we were to recommend leveraging a COTS solution._

## Prerequisites
_we've identified some prerequisites that must be complete before pursuing a recommendation from this working group. These items have prevented significant progress thus far and will only make matters worse if not addressed prior to additional investment (either build or buy)_

| Prerequisite | Rationale |
| -------------| ----------|
| [Zuora SSOT](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4664) | Zuora needs to be the SSOT for our Product Catalog, and what a customer has bought (subs, invoices, payments, etc) |
| [Customer as a First Class Citizen](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1874) | As of 2022-02 we map a user to a subscription, but a Zuora account maps to a customer. We need to resolve this before scaling to a new or improved system | 
| [SSO](gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#1868) | As of 2022-02 a customer can have two logins, their GitLab.com account AND an account on customers.gitlab.com, we need to merge these and maintain a single SSO system (gitlab.com account) |

## Exit Criteria 

1. Identification and prioritization of all prerequisites on appropriate team roadmaps (WG will not cover delivery/execution)
1. Recommendation on how to deliver long-term objectives, including assessment on build vs buy.

## Timeline

### Path 1 (2022-02-02 > 2022-02-18) - 2 weeks

    1. Omar Fernandez 
    1. Alex Martin 

### Path 2 (2022-02-18 > 2022-03-04) - 2 weeks
1. Develop a feature matrix with a prioritized list of features we'd want in our future state and evaluate cost to build them ourselves, whether available in vendor options, and cost to integrate each vendor. 
    1. Kazem Kutob
    1. Omar Fernandez
    1. Jerome Ng
1. Vendor asessment - how would it plug into our systems
    1. Bryan Wise

1. Recommendation on how to deliver long-term objectives, including assessment on build vs buy. 
    1. Justin Farris



## Out of Scope
1. We will not be performing a deep RFP and vendor assessment and selection as part of this exercise
1. Aligning on cross-functional values and operating principles to deliver on e-commerce is out of scope in this WG, but such work may follow in a different format in the next phase
