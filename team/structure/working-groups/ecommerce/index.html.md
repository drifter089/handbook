## Business Goals

Self-service and e-commerce are key levers to the success of our business (also now part of 12 Cross-Functional Initiatives). They drive customer satisfaction and adoption, deliver GTM efficiency, assist in channel development and ultimately, expand our revenue and improve our position in the market.

As the demands of the business grow in complexity and the areas that self-service touches increase, it will be crucial for us to align on one, common self-service strategy.

The goal of this group is to ultimately define the most effective way to deliver on self-service and bridge the gap between where we are today and our long-term vision and objectives.


## Exit Criteria 
1. Defined long-term / future-state of the self-service business needs across all teams and departments in a JTBD framework
1. Document the current state of self-service capabilities
1. Document gaps between current self-service capabilities and ideal future state
1. Document risks or blockers to delivering ideal future-state based on our existing architecture
1. Recommendation on how to deliver long-term objectives, including an assessment of build vs. buy.

## Out of Scope
1. We will not be performing a deep RFP and vendor assessment and selection as part of this exercise
1. Aligning on cross-functional values and operating principles to deliver on e-commerce is out of scope in this WG, but such work may follow in a different format in the next phase
