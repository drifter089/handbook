## Goals

This Working Group has the following goals:

1. Define a process for generating, storing and accessing data for training of models from GitLab.com
    - Will this involve buiding an event stream?
1. Establish a framework and tooling for hyper-parameter tuning, retraining, versioning, and deploying new ML models
1. Determine how to distribute machine learning models on self-hosted instances
1. Define a security/legal process for security-related ML models and pre-processing

## Definitions
