## Business Goal

1. Increase [efficiency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#efficiency) through common incident response, analysis, documentation, ongoing management and reporting methods.
1. Increase visibility and communication of incidents to business and e-group
1. Enhance our clients confidence in Gitlab's ability to quickly resolve and communicate incidents when they occur
1. Align Incident Management activities and priorities with those of the business
1. Create training modules for the Engineer Department on the Incident Management Process at Gitlab

 


## Exit Criteria

1. Uniform approach to incident response management that will be applicable to all areas of Engineering and teams who provide Incident Response 
  * Each functional area of Engineering will develop their own Incident management requirements for identifying and reacting to a service outage or security threat.
  
2. Create a comprehensive knowledge base for Gitlab team members to help understand how teams implement the process IR
