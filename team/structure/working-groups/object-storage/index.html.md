## Charter

GitLab stores three classes of user data: database records, Git
repositories, and user uploaded files.

User experience, as well as contributors experience, with our file
storage has room for significant improvement.

- Initial GitLab setup experience requires creation and setup of [13
  buckets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html#storage-specific-configuration),
  instead of just 1.
- Features using file storage require contributors to think about both local
  storage and Object Storage which leads to friction and
  complexity. This often results in broken features and security issues.
- People contributing to file storage often have to write code also
  for Workhorse, Omnibus, and CNG.

The working group will be reducing technical debt that has been
accrued over the past few years, namely removing CarrierWave and not
duplicating object storage clients in both Go and Ruby.

The working group is tasked with architecting a simplified Object
Storage process and implimenting the new solution.

## Business goal

Improve SaaS scalability, reliability and development speed making
sure object storage is available for every type of upload.

Improve feature adoption for self-managed customers, providing a
[single bucket
configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292958)
that works out of the box.

Object storage is a key feature in GitLab that affects engineering
groups across all sections. The outcome of the working group should
also make it easier for engineers to contribute to the final solution.

## Scope and definitions

Object storage is a fundamental component of GitLab, providing the
underlying implementation for shared, distributed, highly-available
(HA) file storage.

Over time, we have built support for object storage across the
application, solving specific problems in [multitude of
iterations](#company-efforts-on-uploads). This has led to increased
complexity across the board, from development (new features and bug
fixes) to installation:

* New GitLab installations require the creation and configuration of
  several object storage buckets instead of just one, as each group of
  features requires its own. This has an impact on the installation
  experience and new feature adoption, and takes further away from
  boring solutions.
* The realease of cloud native GitLab necessitated the removal of NFS
  shared storage and the development of direct upload, a feature that
  was expanded, milestone after milestone, to several type of uploads,
  but never enabled globally.
* Today GitLab supports both local storage and object storage. Local
  storage only works on single box installations or with a NFS, which
  [we no longer
  recommend](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/nfs.html)
  to our users and is no longer in use on GitLab.com.
* Understanding all the moving parts and the flow is extremely
  complicated: we have CarrierWave, Fog, Golang S3/Azure SDKs, all
  being used, and that complicates testing as well.
* Fog and CarrierWave are not maintained to the level of the native
  SDKs (e.g. AWS S3 SDK), so we end up having to maintain or monkey
  patch those tools to support requested customer features
  (e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/242245) that
  would normally be "free".
* In many cases, we copy around object storage files needlessly
  (e.g. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285597). Large
  files (LFS, packages, etc.) are slow to finalize or don't work at
  all as a result.

### Definitions

<dl>

<dt>CarrierWave</dt>
<dd>A gem that provides a simple and extremely flexible way to upload files from Ruby applications. This was the boring solution when first implemented. However this is no longer our use-case, as we upload files from Workhorse, and we had to [patch CarrierWave's internals](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285597#note_452696638) to support Direct Upload.
</dd>

<dt>Direct upload</dt>
<dd>A technology we developed to intercept file
uploads with Workhorse and handle the expensive upload operation in
Workhorse, where it's cheaper. See our [uploads development
documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/uploads.html#)
for more details.</dd>

## Exit criteria

* Design a new simplified architecture for Object Storage.
* Create the necessary issues and plan out when the implementation of the newly designed architecture will be completed.
* Oversee the implementation of the new architecture.
* Ensure there is clear documentation written using and contributing to newly designed Object Storage.
* Ensure each type of upload will be intercepted by Workhorse and processed according to the new design.
* Identify features and configuration that should be deprecated to reduce the maintenance complexity.


## Roles and responsibilities

The functional leads will be responsible for:

* Representing the needs of individual stakeholders in their department/sub-dept.
* Gathering and consolidating feedback on specific proposals from their department/sub-dept.
* Communicating the output from the working group (if any) and answering questions from their dept/sub-dept.

Ideally, the functional lead is someone who is an IC working in the affected groups, but anyone capable of representing a group, department, or sub-department in the fashion mentioned above is welcome.

# Company efforts on uploads

At GitLab we work in [iterations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration),
direct upload was developed by several teams incrementally by adding new features over the course of several milestones.

To demonstrate the number of teams and milestones involved, the timeline
of the Object Storage development, from feature development to tech
debt and security fixes, is outlined:

- From **10.4** to **10.5** the CI/CD team worked on a [product discovery](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/4184) to figure out how we could remove the NFS storage to allow the release of a cloud native GitLab.
- In **10.6** the CI/CD team developed [direct upload for Git LFS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3507).
- In **10.7** the plan team ported [Object Storage support from EE to CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/40781).
- In **10.7** the CI/CD team implemented [direct upload for artifacts, only on Google Cloud Storage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/4183).
- In **10.8** and **11.0** the CI/CD team implemented [direct upload for artifacts on AWS S3 and compatible storages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/44142).
- In **11.1** the plan team implemented [direct upload for user attachments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/44663).
- In **12.5** the delivery team worked on some [technical debt](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22547), this was [a blocker for our 50k reference architecture](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/performance/-/issues/66) as well as causing several problems on GitLab.com infrastructure, like [VMs reboots](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/7872), [LFS Access Forbidden](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32718), and [problems with the new pre environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/delivery/-/issues/392).
- In **12.6** we fixed a P1/S1 security issue - [Path traversal leading to Remote Code Execution](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36029). After the fix, P2/S2 variations of the original issues where reported:
  - In **12.7** and **12.8** we fixed [a path traversal in dependency proxy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/36324).
  - In **12.10** we fixed [a path traversal in NPM packages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/121735).
  - In **13.0** we fixed [a path traversal in Nuget packages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211636).
  - In **13.5** we fixed a P1/S1 [path traversal on Git LFS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/255886).
- In **12.7** we fixed a P1/S1 security issue - [Workhorse bypass leads to package disclosure and file disclosure in `/tmp`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/209080). After the fix, P1/S1 variations of the same attack where reported:
  - In **12.10** we fixed two workhorse bypasses, one for [Nuget packages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213040) and one for [artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213139).
  - Another security release, still in **12.10**, was needed to completely fix [Nuget packages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214636).
  - In **13.2** we fixed a [workhorse bypass in Maven repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/225259).
  - In **13.3** we fixed a [workhorse bypass in Conan repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/228841).
- In **13.1** an IC added [consolidated object storage configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/34460).
- In **13.2** an IC added a [S3 client to Workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/-/issues/222) to improve multipart uploads and ETag checking.
- In **13.3** an IC added [support for AWS S3 server side encryption](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22200).
- In **13.4** an IC added [support for Azure Blob storage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25877).
- From **13.4** to **14.0** the Release group [transitioned GitLab Pages from NFS to Object Storage](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3901) following the [GitLab Pages New Architecture blueprint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/cloud_native_gitlab_pages/index.html)
