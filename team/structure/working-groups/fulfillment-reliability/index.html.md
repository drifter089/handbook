## Business Goals

A fulfillment system that is well-documented and easily understood by all stakeholders.
The system will be resiliant, reliable, and observable from the ground-up.
In addition to addressing our current use-cases, the system will easily accomodate the addition
of new purchasing workflows (like channel partners), metered billing, and project Horse.
Finally, this should all be achieved without sacrifices to the buyer experience. Touchpoints with
the product(s) should be even more seamless than they are today, especially if/as we begin surfacing
up-sell opportunities directly in the product.

## Definitions

### What is Fulfillment?

At GitLab, "fulfillment" generally refers to the [Fulfillment Sub-department](/handbook/engineering/development/fulfillment/) of Engineering.

For the purposes of this Working Group, "fulfillment" is an all-encompasing term to describe
the end-to-end purchasing experience including (but not necessarily limited to) ordering, billing,
licensing, as well as all of our internal workflows (like lead generation for Sales, and reporting for Finance).

## Exit Criteria 

The charter of this working group is to obtain alignment between stackholders (i.e. Engineering (Development),
Enterprise Apps, Sales, and Finance). This includes addressing some immediate-term technical debt as well as
defining a clear vision and team/service boundaries going forward.
