### Charter

The GitLab Administration Working Group will determine the work needed to maintain [GitLab Administrator](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/) functions healthy, identify owning groups for requests, and redirect issues to corresponding groups for resolution. This group is a temporary owner for all GitLab Administrator functions until a team is funded to be a permanent owner.

### Context

The maintenance and enhancement of GitLab Administration functions has been a shared responsibility among Development groups. This often triggers the same questions about shared responsibilities - who owns this and who should work on this. Before a development owning group can be identified, a working group will help us to maintain the related functions to run GitLab (the software) smoothly.

### Exit Criteria 

1. Owners of the items in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qz8BCuop-M_s6xF5CEpdHWAjgPAY8NAX3PHLzm90m_4/edit#gid=0) are identified, acknowledged, and documented in the handbook.
2. Owners of things related to instance management (upgrade, backup and restore, metrics, performance) and configuration are identified, acknowledged, and documented in the handbook.
3. A proposal for a new team in case there is a need for certain items of the GitLab Administrator features. There is a chance this is unnecessary if the above two items exhaust all features.
4. A process of identifying Owners for future administration features is documented in the handbook.
