## Business Goal

The efficiency of both demo and test data is key to moving our business faster. We have fragmented locations where these data resides and are provisioned. There is also a knowledge gap between what is used in technical sales and what is used in test and validation.  

We will benefit from tooling efficiency together and broaden visiblity of demo data in the field and test data in Engineering.

### Exit Criteria (0% completed)

1. Improve built in demo data via sample project templates
1. Delivery of first working demo data usable by SAs in the field
1. Delivery of add-on automation to update demo data via GitLab Triage
1. Implement automated test data provisioning for test environments  
1. Identify differences and gaps between demo and test data 
1. Publish Demo/Test data structure in the handbook along with identified future DRIs
1. Provision first 3 versions of test/demo data on all developer used test environments (staging,review apps and GDK)
