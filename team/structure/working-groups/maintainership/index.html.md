## Business Goal

We have seen overall inconsistent results with maintainership in the last quarter. Examples: A subset of maintainers are taking the burden of reviews which can lead to serious problems in job satisfaction issues and burnout. We are growing (both in headcount as well as community contributions), but the number of maintainers has stabilized. The number of repos which need maintainer support is increasing while coverage of them has decreased. We want transparency that seniors who are maintainers are having a positive impact in the multiple areas listed here, which leads to more career opportunities for them than it does non-maintainers. 

Our objective is to change our processes and culture to have an organization which we know can sustain maintainership for the next 5 years that meets the demand of both the company and the open core project. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Increasing current maintainers and having a forecasting to know we will increase in the future.
* Availability measures which demonstrate maintainers are able to meet demands of code reviews
* Load balancing measures to distribute MR reviews evenly among maintainers
* Improvements in code review features and CI/tooling to support the maintainers and reduce work needed for reviews
* Coverage/monitoring measures to know when a part of the code base is adequately supported or needs help
* Improvements in onboarding maintainers at our new scale
* Have some fun
