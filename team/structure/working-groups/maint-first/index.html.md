## Business Goals

Transition R&D teams quickly to this new model driven by backlog types, automated SLO guidelines, and balanced prioritization ratios. This should not wait until complete burn-down of their Reliability & Security debt backlog (estimate all teams by the end of May). However, we should expect maintenance to be high in this new model, until we reach that steady state.

Benefits include:

* A healthier balance of work types (features, maintenance items, bugs)
* Improved transparency for stakeholders
* Ability to respond quicker to changing needs
