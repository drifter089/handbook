## Business Goal

Transition R&D teams immediately to this new model driven by backlog types, automated SLO guidelines & healthy prioritization ratios. This should not wait until complete burn-down of their Reliability & Security debt backlog (estimate all teams by the end of May). But we should expect maintenance to be high in this new model, until we reach that steady state.

* Teams backlog slates containing view of all backlog types.
  * Security
  * Reliability
  * UX / SUS
  * Bugs
* Teams merged work type slate (historical & real time)
* Stakeholders slate, view of progress and ratio attainment
* Automation guardrails to enforce hygiene & SLO
* Handbook team dashboards

[Work type improvements & initial dashboards have been completed prior to the working group.](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1799#pre-work-by-april-15th)
