## Business Goal

Transition R&D teams into a steady prioritization state driven by backlog types, automated SLO guidelines & healthy prioritization ratios. Teams to start transition to this state after the complete burn-down of their Reliability & Security debt backlog (estimate all teams by the end of May). 

Start with teams that are not in Engineering Allocations first with a goal of attaining overall R&D steady state. Activation mechanisms:
* Teams backlog slates containing view of all backlog types.
  * Security
  * Reliability
  * UX / SUS
  * Bugs
* Teams merged work type slate (historical & real time)
* Stakeholders slate, view of progress and ratio attainment
* Automation guardrails to enforce hygiene & SLO
* Handbook team dashboards

[Work type improvements & initial dashboards have been completed prior to the working group.](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1799#pre-work-by-april-15th)
