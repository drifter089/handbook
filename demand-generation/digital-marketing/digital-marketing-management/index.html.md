### Working with PMG, our Digital agency
All digital campaigns are executed with the help of our digital agency PMG (learn more about PMG [here](https://www.pmg.com/)). The only exception is account-centric Paid Display which is handled directly through [Demandbase](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/account-based-strategy/demandbase/), but PMG still handles regular Paid Display. For GitLab digital initiatives, PMG provides:

* Strategy & planning - Covering full-funnel paid strategy both holistically and granularly, considering the GitLab brand and audience for all channels and tactics.
* Buying & executing - Gathering all necessary campaign materials (goals & objectives, creative, copy, targeting, etc) to launch, and strategically bidding/negotiating for ad units/packages and optimizing for more efficient costs towards goals throughout campaigns.
* Insights & reporting - Aggregating all digital performance into custom report dashboards, offering actionable insights for audience, asset, regional, and  campaign performance within each issue, and reviewing overall performance over time to uncover trends & opportunities.
* Billing - Handling all paid digital spend directly with publishers & platforms, then syncing with GitLab finance to manage invoicing.

GitLab DMPs work directly with PMG within the GitLab [Digital Advertising project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-advertising), which is strictly for DMP & PMG communication only. To learn how PMG is involved in the paid digital request process, please refer to the [DMP Request Workflow](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/digital-marketing-management/#dmp-request-workflows) section below.

### Program definitions

#### **Paid Search**: 
Paid search are [text ads](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704389?hl=en) on Google and/or Bing search engines to drive people to specific GitLab landing pages as they are looking for information on search engines. We do this by [bidding](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2459326?hl=en) on targeted keywords and phrases based on the assumed intent of the person and matching that intent with a related landing page. 
* **Best used for**: Mid and bottom funnel content where we want someone to take action (ex: filling our a form to a gated asset, signing up for a demo, etc).
     * **Best type of content to use**: Use case type gated assets that directly applies to the intent for the search query. How-to guides and ebooks do well here. 
     * **Worst type of content to use**: Events and thought leadership reports/whitepapers like Gartner and Forrester reports that are not specifically tied to the intent of a search query. Caveat here is if the content is more of a how to report or guide. 
NOTE: Facebook has a one week "listening" period, where they optimize spend to ensure we are getting the best possible ROI. 

#### **Paid Display**: 
Display ads are banner ads that we mostly run are through the [Google Display Network](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2404190?hl=en). Banner ads will show on websites that have [Google Adsense](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6242051?hl=en) set-up on their website. There are no specific websites we show banner ads on - we earn the ad space by bidding on placements based on specific targeting criteria such as demographics, topics, and interests. On occassion, we run banner ads on websites through direct buys. This is handled more in the publisher program. 
* **Best used for**: Top and mid funnel content. More used for awareness and some action based response.
     * **Best type of content to use**: How-to guides, ebooks, and general awareness content promotion do well here. Trial ads tend to do well if used in some for of remarketing strategy.
     * **Worst type of content to use**: Events and thought leadership reports/whitepapers like Gartner and Forrester reports. Because there is a learning period when running Display advertising, running Events through Display advertising is not recommended due to the short promotion period. With leadership reports/whitepapers, we historically have not seen good engagement and sign-ups for these types of assets on Display advertising. 
* **Types of targeting we do**:
     * **Contextual targeting**: Show banners ads on websites that are related to the content of our landing page and website. This is done based on keyword and topic targeting.
     * **Prospecting targeting**: Show banner ads to related audiences that are similar to those who have converted on our website. A profile is developed based on people who convert. We would then show banner ads to people that closely match that profile. This method helps drive new traffic to GitLab that may not know about the brand or product. 
     * **Remarketing**: Show banner ads in order to re-engage people who have already visited pages on the GitLab website. This tactic can show ads on what seems to be irrelevant websites. However, targeting is based on the engagement of the person, not the context of a website. 

#### **Paid Social**:
Paid social ads are ads that we show on social platforms. The three social media platforms that we primarily advertise on are Facebook/Instagram, LinkedIn (this includes LinkedIn InMail & Conversation Ads), and Twitter. 
* **Best used for**: Top and mid funnel content. Does well for both awareness and direct response (depending on the asset used).
     * **Best type of content to use**: Live webcasts, recorded webcasts, events, and ebooks/guides. Live events with a sign-up deadline, tend to perform the best in paid social. 
     * **Worst type of content to use**: Thought leadership reports/whitepapers like Gartner and Forrester reports.
* **Types of targeting we do**:
     * **Prospecting targeting**: Sponsored ads to audiences that are built based on personas using interest, professional, and demographic targeting. A profile is developed based on people who convert. We would then show ads to people natively within either Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn that closely match that profile. This method helps drive new traffic to GitLab that may not know about the brand or product. 
     * **Account targeting**: Sponsored ads on targeting speciific accounts or contacts based on a list upload or import from Marketo. LinkedIn is the top channel for this type of marketing based on a +90% account match rate, whereas Facebook and Instagram requires accounts to be manually entered in order to target.
     * **Remarketing**: Show  ads in order to re-engage people who have already visited pages on the GitLab website.

#### **Publisher Sponsorships**:
Publisher sponsorships are when we engage a specific publisher in order to purchase placement on their web properties. Generally, we make sure the publisher's website(s) and audience closely match the profile of who we want to advertise to before engaging with the publisher. Additionally, we want to make sure the programs that are offered by the publisher align with our goals. 
* **Best used for**: Primarily used for demand generation, so we focus on mid to bottom funnel content.
     * **Best type of content to use**: Live webcasts and recorded webcasts work the best. Ebooks and guides sometimes work, depending on the placement. 
     * **Worst type of content to use**: Events and thought leadership reports/whitepapers like Gartner and Forrester reports. With leadership reports/whitepapers, we historically have not seen good engagement and sign-ups for these types of assets on Paid Social, unless the report is more of a how-to guide.

## LinkedIn InMail & Conversation Ad Campaigns

### InMail (Message Ads)

LinkedIn InMail Ads (also known as Message Ads) are static messages delivered directly to LinkedIn member inboxes, creating a personalized ad experience between the user and GitLab. These ads are highly effective for middle-funnel campaigns, targeting specific individuals with custom tailored content relevant to their persona and/or organization. Since many users also have LinkedIn notify their personal or work email address when they have received an InMail, this results in up to 2x higher open rates and click throughs than traditional single email campaigns. Unlike our main paid digital bid type of costs per click, we pay for the message open which generally costs around $1 - $1.50 each. However, when a user shares the ad to other users, those users' opens and clicks are free. As a result, the free sharing feature allows our campaigns to obtain greater reach at a lower cost. This is especially useful in Account Based Marketing campaigns; a manager receiving an InMail to attend an upcoming GitLab webinar can share with other users in their organization. InMail/Message Ads can be used to re-engage and nurture accounts with upcoming events, new content assets, or by simply opening the conversation. 

### Conversation Ads

Conversation Ads are similar to InMail Ads in terms of placement, costs, and targeting, but instead of a static message, the user is able to engage through a sequence of messages prompted by specific CTA buttons, creating an interactive experience with GitLab. Conversation Ads are delivered directly to the LinkedIn member’s inbox, starting off with an intro message offering a variety of CTA buttons and proceeding through a custom sequence with each button click, resulting in several layers of interactions. LinkedIn reporting features visualization into engagement through the message flow, highlighting which messages & CTAs users found most relevant and where conversation drops off. These CTAs can click through to the next message  (“Tell me more”), click out to a relevant landing page (“See case studies”), click out to an event registration page (“Register now”), or open an lead generation form (“Sign up now”). Conversation Ads are essentially a Choose Your Own Adventure interaction that provide target audiences with more options and provide us with more audience insights.

If you are requesting InMail or Conversation Ads, create an issue in the general [Paid Digital Request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/new?issuable_template=paid-digital-request).


### Sender Collaboration

InMail & Conversation Ad campaigns must have a designated sender in order to send messages on behalf of GitLab, putting a friendly face to the company name. The ads displayed in a member’s inbox will appear to be sent from the designated sender, which allows for increased personalization and message relevance to targeted members.

In order for our digital agency PMG to set up sender permissions, they’ll need to send requests to those whom we want to grant sender permissions, which are typically SDRs but can include a variety of titles & teams at GitLab. Since sender requests can only be sent to 1-degree connections, a member of the PMG team will first send a LinkedIn connection request, then the sender request once the connection is approved. When the designated team member receives a request to be a sender on a LinkedIn Messaging campaign, they can approve or reject this request by following the link provided in the email. The GitLab team member can also [use this link](https://www.linkedin.com/ad/accounts?destination=sponsored-inmail-sender-permissions) to manage their sender permissions and see whether they have sender access for a campaign. Once the GitLab team member has accepted their sender permissions to be added as a sender on the account, they will need to notify the DMP by confirming within the campaign issue.

### Copy


Although Digital Marketing can generate copy, we highly recommend that the sender, another member of the sender’s team, or a PMM generate the copy to be used in messages since they have more insight & context around targeted accounts, user/buyer persona, and/or the promoted content. When creating an InMail or Conversation Ad campaign, the Ad Copy Template doc (included for both ad types in the [Paid Digital Request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/new?issuable_template=paid-digital-request)) will be cloned for your specific campaign and used as a collaborative space for the sender to generate messaging and other campaign members to edit where necessary. Conversation Ad copy will be more complex, as it includes several layers of messages and multiple CTA options for each layer. Please note that due to the high volume of messages within a given campaign, LinkedIn restricts replies from the target audience to the sender. If the sender prefers replies, they can include a link to their Calendly or email address in the message. One of the key benefits of InMail & Conversation Ads is that you can personalize copy with macros. Macros allow you to pull a member’s LinkedIn profile data and insert them dynamically into your ad for more personalization. Profile data options include first name, last name, job title, company name, and industry.

**InMail Copy Best Practices:**
* Customize the greeting with the member’s name 
* Refer to their job title  
* Try using the word “you"
* The copy is fewer than 1,000 characters
* The CTA is clear
* The landing page is optimized for mobile

Best performing subject lines often use some of the following keywords:
* Thanks 
* Exclusive invitation  
* Connect 
* Job opportunities  
* Join us  

Additional ways that we can test with message tone of voice:
* Genuine
* The Helpful Advisor
* VIP Invitation - sending personalized invites to 'exclusive' events
* The Cliffhanger

**Conversation Ad Copy Best Practices:**
* Always start with your main goal and/or objective: What is the ideal action you want the member to take when they receive your Conversation Ad? 
* To drive brand consideration: Link to your blog posts, pre-recorded webinars, or industry trends and analysis
* To drive leads and turn prospects into customers: Share product demos or tutorials, customer success stories, or invite prospects to attend an event
* Introduce yourself: When using an individual as a sender, use the opening message to introduce yourself and let members know why you’re reaching out
* There’s no subject line for Conversation Ads. Like any other LinkedIn message, the first sentence will appear as the subject. Because your audience will see this in their LinkedIn Messaging, make your first sentence count. 
* Use multiple messages & buttons: Your conversation should have 2 to 5 layers. Each layer will consist of message text and at least 2 CTA buttons with responses to the question in your message. For instance, if your goal is to drive content downloads, share two pieces of content that your audience can choose from. 
* Don’t include “Not Interested” or “No Thanks” CTAs: Avoid including this in the first layer of your conversation. Prospects who aren’t interested will just close the ad. Instead, focus on using CTAs they can learn from.
* Ask your email marketing team for ideas: Check in with your email marketing team to understand what works best for them. Use their top performing email copy as inspiration for your Conversation Ad. 
* Keep copy short & sweet: Conversation Ads are meant to feel more like a live conversation. Keep your messages short and friendly, and don’t forget about the character limits. Consider using language that is more casual, the way you would over the phone.
* Stick to a conversational tone: While you may be engaging a B2B audience, remember that it’s people who make the decisions to buy your product or service, and they want to know that your brand is human and authentic.


## UTMs for URL tagging and tracking
All URLs that are promoted on external sites and through email must use UTM URL tagging to increase the data cleanliness in Google Analytics and ensure marketing campaigns are correctly attributed. 

We don't use UTMs for internal links. UTM data sets attribution for visitors, so if we use UTMs on internal links it resets everything when the clicked URL loads. This breaks reporting for paid advertising and organic visitors.

You can access our internal [URL tagging tool in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12jm8q13e3-JNDbJ5-DBJbSAGprLamrilWIBka875gDI/edit#gid=0). You will also find details in this spreadsheet on what "Campaign Medium" to use for each URL. If you need a new campaign medium, please check with the Digital Marketing Programs team as new mediums will not automatically be attributed correctly.

If you are not sure if a link needs a UTM, please speak with the marketer who is managing your campaign to ensure you are not interrupting the reporting structure they have in place.

UTM construction best practices:
- lowercase only, not camelcase
- alphanumeric characters only
- no spaces
- **Campaign Medium** covers general buckets like `paidsearch`, `social`, or `sponsorship` 
- **Campaign Source** names where the link lives. Examples include `ebook`, `twitter`, or `qrcode`
- **Campaign Name** describes a specific campaign. Try to add additional context like `reinvent`, `forrester`, and `bugbounty`
- **Campaign Content** differentiates ad types.
- **Campaign Term** identifies keywords used in a campaign


## Opt-Out of Seeing GitLab Digital Ads

We run digital ads on the following channels:

* Google (paid search and display)
* Facebook
* LinkedIn
* Twitter
* Demandbase (paid display)

Because everyone at GitLab works remotely, it makes it difficult to restrict ads from being shown to GitLabbers. In a brick and mortar environment, we can easily block IP addresses to accomplish this. Because everyone at GitLab has a different IP address, and even dynamic IP addresses, there is no way to implement an exclusion rule that would block all GitLab ads to GitLabbers. 

If you would not like to see GitLab ads, you are able to opt-out of ads as you see them. Below is the process to remove GitLab ads. Please note that if you use both your personal and work accounts on your devices, you will need to exclude from both your personal and work accounts.

1. On the upper right-hand corner of the ad, click the arrow
2. When option box appears, click on “I don’t like this ad”
* Note that this does not necessarily block all ads, just that specific ad. You would need to do this on all the ads you see from GitLab
* You could block @gitlab in your profile to no longer see ads. However you block all ability to engage with the @gitlab Twitter accounts as well (seeing Tweets, Retweeting, mentioning, etc).
