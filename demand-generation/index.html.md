<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**[(Sisense) Demand Gen Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/793304/Demand-Gen-Dashboard)**

The Demand Generation Dashboard uses
* [Bizible touchpoints](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible/#bizible-touchpoints) to track Inquiries, MQLs, and SDR Accepted metrics
* [Linear Bizible Attribution touchpoints model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible/#linear-attribution) to track Opportunities, Total IACV$, SAO, Pipeline IACV$, Won Deals count, and Won IACV $

[See this epic for additional updates being requested/made to the Demand Gen Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/629). 

To add a new integrated campaign group, open an issue by using the [demand-gen-dashboard template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-strategy-performance/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/demand-gen-dashboard.md) in the Marketing Strategy & Performance project

#### Dashboard Filters and Functionalities
{: #dashboard-filters-functionalities}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**Filters:**
* **Date Range**: based on Bizible touchpoint date
* **Group By Time:** You can toggle between different date aggregation (MoM,QoQ,YoY). _Note: If you use the dashboard for the very first time, you need to select any value in this filter in order to make the charts work on the dashboard._
* **Touchpoint Segment:** multi-select filter with the option of `Demand Gen` and `Other` (if you select both, you would be able to see All touchpoints). `Other` touchpoints cover any non-Demand Gen data (e.g.: FMM, Direct, Organic Search etc.). Touchpoint Segment **does not** filter the PMG cost.
* **Integrated Campaign:** filters the charts and tables by integrated campaign group. `Free Trial` covers the Estimated Free Trials only.
* **SFDC Sales Segment:** based on the sales segment on the lead object and the sales segment on the account linked to the contact. SFDC Sales Segment filters the PMG Cost based on the utm_segment in PMG data, that is defined in the `budget` field in their database. PMG Segments: SMB, Mid-Market, Large, Prospecting, Retargeting
* **SFDC Region Normalized:** it's the Region on the lead object and the region on the account linked to the contact. PMG Cost is filtered by the region taken from the PMG campaign name
* **Country:** mailing address country on the lead and contact records, for the opportunities we are using the contact's mailing address. (Note: Marketo forms collect the mailing address). Country **does not** filter the PMG cost.
* **SFDC Order Type Stamped, Opp Sales Stype, Opp Deal Path:** filters the post opportunity metrics (SAO,WON) only (so it is not linked to Inquiries, MQL, SDR Accepted). PMG Cost is not filtered.

**How to filter New First Order Logos?**

Select `SFDC_Order_Type_Stamped = 1. New - First Order` (this does not filter the `Opp_Sales_Type filter`).

**How to filter Growth?**

Select `SFDC_Order_Type_Stamped = 1. New - First Order, 2. New - Connected, 3. Growth` to expand the view beyond first orders.

**How to use `Opp_Deal_Path` filter?**

`Web direct` covers web portal purchase. Deal Path is `Channel` when the Partner Account name is not blank on the opportunity.


**Functionalities:**
* **Dynamic KPI Charts:** Some charts are dynamic meaning that you are able to switch the KPI in the dropdown menu in the top left corner. The Y axis format changes based on the selected KPI ($, %). If you want to temporarly remove some values in the chart series. You can do that by clicking on the relevant label in the legend. Double-clicking on a label in the legend will display the desired label only.
* **Date Aggregation:** with the `Group By Time` filter you can change the date granularity on the [Date Range Comparison table](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/793304/Demand-Gen-Dashboard?widget=10984808&udv=1198278) and the trend charts ([Acquisition and Opportunity $ Trend](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/793304/Demand-Gen-Dashboard?widget=10531936&udv=1198278),[Conversion % and CPA Trend](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/793304/Demand-Gen-Dashboard?widget=10540142&udv=1198278)).
* **Pivot Table:** To create your own pivot table in the tables under the Table Summary sections, click on the top right corner of the table > Edit Pivot. For the conversion rates (INQ>MQL, MQL>SAO, SAO>WON) use average in the Pivot value settings. **Important**: max 5MB data can be downloaded due to browser data download size limitations (eg.: if you select Demand Gen and Other in the Touchpoint Segment filter, the data volume will be too too large to display in the tables)

#### Demand Gen Touchpoints
{: #demand-gen-touchpoints}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

The below table shows how we select the demand gen related touchpoints and addes them into the integrated campaign groups. We take online touchpoints (utm parameters from the form, landing page URLs) and the offline campaigns (such as LinkedIn Lead Gen) as well.

**How to make sure that the LinkedIn Lead Gen campaigns will be captured properly by the dashboard?**

 You need to follow this steps while setting up the LinkedIn Lead Gen campaigns: [Steps to Setup Linkedin Lead Gen Form *Gated Content Only](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#steps-to-setup-linkedin-lead-gen-form-gated-content-only). Important to note that the campaign name should include the campaign parameters, as the dashboard is using them to add into the different campaign groups.

## Tactic-Specific Dashboards
{: #dashboard-by-tactic}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

SFDC reports and dashboards to track program performance real-time. Data from the below SFDC reports/dashboards along with anecdotal feedback gathered during program retros will be used as guidelines for developing and growing various marketing campaigns.

The SFDC report/dashboard is currently grouped by program types so MPMs can easily compare and identify top performing and under performing programs within the areas that they are responsible for.

### Key Metrics tracked on ALL virtual events dashboards
{: #dashboard-virtual-events}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*Note: Virtual Events include Webcast, Live Demos and Virtual Sponsorship*

* **Total Registration :** The number of people that registered for the virtual event regardless whether they attend or not.
* **Total Attendance:** The number of people that attended the LIVE virtual event (exclude people who watched the on-demand version).
* **Attendance Rate:** % of people that attended the LIVE virtual event out of the total registered (i.e: Total Attendance / Total Registration).
* **Net New Names:** The number of net new names added to our marketing database driven by the virtual event. Because a net new person record may be inserted into our CRM (SFDC) as a lead or a contact object therefore, we need to add `Total net new leads` and `Total net new contacts` to get the overall total net new names.
* **Influenced Pipe:** Total New and Add-on business pipeline IACV$ influenced by people who attended the LIVE virtual event. The webcast and live demo dashboards currently use SFDC out of the box `Campaigns with Influenced opportunities` report type because Bizible was implemented in June'18 and therefore the attribution report did not capture data prior to this. We plan to migrate webcast and live demo influenced pipe reports to Bizible attribution report in the next dashboard iteration so they align with overall marketing reporting.

#### Virtual Events Reporting
{: #reporting-virtual-events}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

The [Webcast Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z6100000079e6) tracks all webcasts hosted on GitLab's internal webcast platform. It is organized into 3 columns. The left and middle columns tracks 2 different webcast series (Release Radar vs. CI/CD webcast series). The right column tracks various one-off webcasts since Jan'18.

The [Live Demo Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z6100000079f4) is organized into 2 columns. The left column tracks the bi-weekly Enterprise Edition product demos (1 hour duration). The bi-weekly Enterprise Edition product demos ran between Q1'18 - Q2'18.
The right column tracks the weekly high level product demo + Q&A session (30 minutes duration). The weekly high level product demo + Q&A session was launched in Q4'18 and currently running through the end of Feb 2019.

The [Virtual Sponsorship Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z61000000UD44) focuses on events that are hosted by a 3rd party where GitLab has purchased a virtual booth or sponsorship.
