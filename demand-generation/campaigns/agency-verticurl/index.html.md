## Project Management - Field Marketing Team 
{: #project-management-field-marketing-team}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

In an effort to avoid manually adding the issues we are working on with Verticurl, Field Marketing will be utilizing labels and boards to manage the work we are working on with Verticurl. Similar to how our campaigns team colleagues are working, all commentary back and forth between GitLab and Verticurl should be done via comments directly within the GitLab issues.
