## Overview
{: #overview .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

This page documents ways in which content is leveraged in campaigns, including in-house created content, analyst relations content, and downloadable competitive content.

In an effort to best engage our technical audience, we are pursuing an **ungated content journey** that leverages Pathfactory tracks, rather than gated landing pages. This allows viewers to preview content before signing up to view in its entirety. We have flexibility about when and how the forms display, and will test to deliver the best experience with proven results. This process will also be more efficient to launch new content so time can be focused on how to leverage the content in campaigns.

The epic code in each section below outlines the necessary issues to open in order to "check off" the list of action items to launch a new piece of content. *While this page exists within the Campaigns Team handbook page, it is meant to be contributed to by all teams in marketing. If you see an updated needed, please submit an MR and assign to `@jgragnola`.*

### Types of content in campaigns
{: #content-types .gitlab-orange}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
* **Content for use in marketing campaigns:** we leverage the content in our marketing channels (website, email nurture, paid digital, organic social, etc.)
    * [Internal GitLab-created content](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/content-in-campaigns#internal-content): We created and developed the content in house
    * [External content (i.e. Analyst Relations)](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/content-in-campaigns#external-content): We have bought the rights to use the content from an external vendor (analysts or publishers, for example) or received the content from a partner
    * [On-Demand Webcasts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/webcast/)
* **[Content syndication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/gated-content/content-syndication)** (under Digital Marketing): We have promoted our content through a third-party vendor, but do not drive people back to our website. In these cases, we often have given them the resource to make available for download to their audience, and recieve the leads to be uploaded.

## How to pick content for campaigns
{: #picking-content-for-campaigns .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
**Search the entire Pathfactory Content Library**

https://gitlab.lookbookhq.com/authoring/content-library/content

Filter by one or multiple of the following:
- Topic
- Content Type
- Funnel Stage
- GTM Motion (Business Unit in Pathfactory)
- Language

**View reports to see what works**

* **Key metric to analyze: Engagement Time**
   - *"Why not total views?"* Engagement time is a better indicator of content effectiveness than views, which can be a self-fulfilling prophesy; the more views, the more it is used, the more it continues to climb in comparison to other content. 

## Internal Content (i.e. eBooks, Guides)
{: #internal-content .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
The below process should be used for all new content (ebooks, guides, whitepapers, etc.). Creating the epic and related issues is the responsibility of the **Content Owner** (i.e. Content Marketing, Analyst Relations) to make sure that when the content is ready, the teams involved in putting into Pathfactory (MOps) and the teams involved in activating (Campaigns, Digital, ABM) are able to take action immediately.

## External Content (i.e. Analyst Relations)
{: #external-content .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
External content can be sourced from Analyst Relations, partners, and other vendors with whom we work. Some examples would be vendor comparisons (i.e. Gartner/Forrester) or industry/market analyses (i.e. DevOps Institute).

When a GitLab team member (i.e. AR) determines that they will be purchasing or recieving content to be used in campaigns, they are responsible for working with the [GTM Motion teams](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22/#core-teams) to discuss how to leverage the content, as well as creating the epics and associated issues to request work of all relevant teams (outlined below to try to make it efficient, comprehensive, and repeatable!).

All external content should be planned in advance of purchase with `at least a 30 business day time to launch date`. This allows time to plan activation into existing and future integrated campaigns and GTM Motions.
