## Overview
{: #overview .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

This page documents ways in which content is leveraged in campaigns, including in-house created content, analyst relations content, and downloadable competitive content.

In an effort to best engage our technical audience, we are pursuing an **ungated content journey** that leverages Pathfactory tracks, rather than gated landing pages. This allows viewers to preview content before signing up to view in its entirety. We have flexibility about when and how the forms display, and will test to deliver the best experience with proven results. This process will also be more efficient to launch new content so time can be focused on how to leverage the content in campaigns.

The epic code in each section below outlines the necessary issues to open in order to "check off" the list of action items to launch a new piece of content. *While this page exists within the Campaigns Team handbook page, it is meant to be contributed to by all teams in marketing. If you see an updated needed, please submit an MR and assign to `@jgragnola`.*

### Types of content in campaigns
{: #content-types .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
* **Content for use in marketing campaigns:** we leverage the content in our marketing channels (website, email nurture, paid digital, organic social, etc.)
    * [Internal GitLab-created content](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/content-in-campaigns#ungated-internal-content): We created and developed the content in house
    * [External content (i.e. Analyst Relations)](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/content-in-campaigns#ungated-external-content): We have bought the rights to use the content from an external vendor (analysts or publishers, for example) or received the content from a partner
    * [On-Demand Webcasts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/virtual-events/webcast/)
* **[Content syndication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/digital-marketing-programs/marketing-programs/gated-content/content-syndication)** (under Digital Marketing): We have promoted our content through a third-party vendor, but do not drive people back to our website. In these cases, we often have given them the resource to make available for download to their audience, and recieve the leads to be uploaded.

## Ungated Content Journeys
{: #ungated-content-journeys .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

### Internal Content (created by the GitLab team)
{: #ungated-internal-content}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
All internally-created GitLab content is aligned to a GTM Motion (and/or aligned sales play) per the [FY22 Marketing Plan](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22/). Internally-created content is organized within content pillars (owned by Content Marketing).

#### Epic code and issues - Internal GitLab Content

### External Content Content (i.e. Analyst Relations)
{: #ungated-external-content}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
External content can be sourced from Analyst Relations, partners, and other vendors with whom we work. Some examples would be vendor comparisons (i.e. Gartner/Forrester) or industry/market analyses (i.e. DevOps Institute).

When a GitLab team member (i.e. AR) determines that they will be purchasing or recieving content to be used in campaigns, they are responsible for working with the [GTM Motion teams](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22/#core-teams) to discuss how to leverage the content, as well as creating the epics and associated issues to request work of all relevant teams (outlined below to try to make it efficient, comprehensive, and repeatable!).

All external content should be planned in advance of purchase with `at least a 30 business day time to launch date`. This allows time to plan activation into existing and future integrated campaigns and GTM Motions.

#### Epic code and issues - External Content

   * Form strategy is required for all content tracks used in demand generation campaigns (located in PathFactory track issue)
   * The content owner must provide 1-3 related assets for the track or request Product Marketing to recommend content.
   * [Process for adding to /resource page](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/content-in-campaigns#add-to-resources-page) remains the same, but in ungated journey, the URL drives to the PF asset/track (not a landing page)

### Marketo automation and setup for gated landing page
{: #steps-gated-landing-pages}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**!!! REMINDER: We are using ungated content journeys via Pathfactory. This process should only be used for specific scenarios, and used sparingly.**

[Watch the video tutorial >](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrmDCZPh1nw)

:exclamation: Dependencies: delivery of final asset, completion of final landing page copy, and final asset added to pathfactory and placed in a track must be complete before setting up the Marketo program.

**The TL;DR of what you'll do:**
* Create Marketo program, tokens, and SFDC campaign sync
* Edit registration page and thank you page URLs
* Activate smart campaign(s)
* Update SFDC campaign
* Test live registration page and flows
* Add new content to the Resources page (separate issue)

#### Create Marketo program, tokens, and SFDC campaign sync
{: #steps-gated-mkto-sfdc}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
  * Clone the [Marketo Gated Content Template](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#PG5111A1) and name new program using naming convention (YYYY_Type_AssetName, i.e. 2020_report_GarnterVOC_ARO)
  * Create SFDC program (Program Summary > `Salesforce campaign sync` > click "not set" and choose "Create New" from dropdown) - leave the name as auto-populates, and add the epic url to the description and "Save"
  * Update Marketo tokens (Program Summary > "My Tokens" tab)
    * `{{my.bullet1}}` - bullet copy with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
    * `{{my.bullet2}}` - bullet copy with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
    * `{{my.bullet3}}` - bullet copy with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
    * `{{my.bullet4}}` - bullet copy with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
    * `{{my.contentDescription}}`	- 2-3 sentences with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679), this will show up in page previews on social and be used in Pathfactory description.
    * `{{my.contentDownloadURL}}` - skip updating in initial registration page setup (update during on-demand switch), Pathfactory link WITHOUT the `https://` NOR the email tracking part (`lb_email=`)
      * Example of correct link to include: `learn.gitlab.com/gartner-voc-aro/gartner-voc-aro` - the code in the Marketo template assets will create the URL `https://learn.gitlab.com/gartner-voc-aro/gartner-voc-aro?lb_email={{lead.email address}}&{{my.utm}}`
      * Note that both parts of this url include custom URL slugs which should be incorporated into all pathfactory links for simplicity of tracking paramaeters
    * `{{my.contentEpicURL}}` - no longer used in automation, but helpful for reference
    * `{{my.contentSubtitle}}` - content subtitle to display to viewer (throughout landing page, emails, etc.)
    * `{{my.contentTitle}}`	- content title to display to viewer (throughout landing page, emails, interesting moments, etc.), with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
    * `{{my.contentType}}`	- content type to display to viewer (throughout landing page, emails, interesting moments, etc.)
    * `{{my.contentTypeSFDC}}` - pick from following list (critical to avoid Marketo > SFDC sync errors): whitepaper, report, video, eBook, general
    * `{{my.emailConfirmationButtonCopy}}`	- leave as `Download`  (but can be updated if needed)
    * `{{my.formButtonCopy}}`	- leave as `Download  now` (but can be updated if needed)
    * `{{my.formHeader}}`	- leave as `Free Instant Download:` (but can be updated if needed)
    * `{{my.formSubhead}}`	- form subhead (not currently used for gated content landing page to try to keep form shorter)
    * `{{my.heroImage}}` - image to display above landing page form ([options in Marketo here](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#FI0A1ZN9784))
    * `{{my.introParagraph}}`	- intro paragraph to be used in landing page and nurture email, with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
    * `{{my.mpm owner email address}}` - no longer used in automation, but helpful to know who to go to about setup
    * `{{my.or}}` - leave as `?` (but can be updated to `&` if during Pathfactory upload, the custom URL slugs were not applied to both the asset and the track). If this is not correctly applied and there are multiple `?` question marks in the URL, it will break. [WATCH THE VIDEO EXPLAINER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHgR33cNeJg)
    * `{{my.pdfVersion}}`	- this should be the GitLab repo link (for safety backup if Pathfactory were to go down)
    * `{{my.socialImage}}`	- image that would be presented in social, slack, etc. preview when the URL is shared, this image is provided by design/social, leave the default unless presented with webcast specific image.
    * `{{my.utm}}` - this should match the aligned campaign utm
    * `{{my.valueStatement}}` token with the short value statement on what the viewer gains from the webcast, this ties into the follow up emails and must meet the max/min requirements of the [character limit checker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)

  * Smart List: *it's all set!* For your first few, feel free to check that it references the program landing page (it should do this automatically)
  * Flow: it's all set! For your first few, feel free to review the flows (but they are all using tokens, so it should be ready to go automatically)
  * Schedule tab: click "Activate" (note: the settings should be that "each person can run through the flow once every 7 days" - this is to avoid bots resubmitting repeatedly)

#### Update SFDC campaign

## Adding new content to the Resources page
{: #add-to-resources-page .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*Note from `@jgragnola`: [open issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/1030) to investigate how to leverage Pathfactory to automatically tap into all content for a better user experience and more efficient process on the GitLab side.*

1. Begin a new MR from [the resources yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/edit/master/data/resources.yml)

3. Add commit message `Add [resource name] to Resources page`, rename your target branch, leave "start a new merge request with these changes" and click "Commit Changes"
5. Assign the merge request to yourself
6. When you've tested the MR in the review app and all looks correct (remember to test the filtering!), assign to `@jgragnola`
7. Comment to `@jgragnola` that the MR is ready to merge

**Code:**
```
- title: 'Add name of resource - shorten if necessary'
  url: 
  image: /images/resources/security.png

## How to retire analyst assets when they expire
{: #retire-analyst-assets .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*Note from @jgragnola: this process needs a lot of work and should be minimal time spent by campaigns team. Create section for ungated journeys, and section (hidden) for former gated pages, and pass to Verticurl.*

* An [Expiration Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=campaigns-expire-analyst) will be open for each analyst asset, and related to the overarching Epic upon gating (with due date for when the asset is set to expire)
* At times, we will extend the rights to an asset if it is heavily used by sales or performing well in later stage nurture. In that case the decisio nis indicated in the Expiration Issue, and the team is updated.

### Retire Marketo landing page
{: #retire-marketo-page .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
**First you will remove the form from the page and add a "no longer available" message**
* In the Marketo program, click "edit" on the Registration Page
* On right rail under "Variables" (below "Elements"), find `2column Visibility` and switch to "Hidden" 
* On right rail under "Variables" (below "Elements"), find `2column Sidebar` and switch to "No Sidebar" 
* On right rail under "Variables" (below "Elements"), find `flex1 Visibility` and switch to "Visible"
* In flex1 section, double-click then click to edit in HTML > add the code below into the section and save
* Approve Landing Page and test live. You should no longer be able to see the form or paragraph text, and only see the notice about resource no longer being available. 

```
<h1>This resource is no longer available.</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this resource, but it is no longer available for download. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/analysts/" target="_blank" id="">Click here to visit our industry analysts page to view other reports and best practices!</a></p>

## Potential backup process
{: #retire-marketo-page .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

To be completed by the content owner if Pathfactory access is granted. If no access, please open an issue in Campaigns team based on epic category above.

**Add to /downloads/ repository** (only available and recommended for assets under 2 MB size)
*The purpose of this step is to make it possible to flip the autoresponder if Pathfactory were to have an outtage, at which point, we would still have the PDF version available in Marketo for a quick turnaround.*

1. Save the pdf to your computer with naming convention `[asset-type]-short-name-asset`, ex: `ebook-agile-delivery-models`
1. Navigate to the (de-indexed) [`resource/download`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/master/sites/marketing/source/resources) directory
1. Where it says `www-gitlab-com / sites / marketing / source / resources / +`, click the plus drop down and select "Upload File"
1. Upload the file you've saved to your computer with the naming convention above
1. For commit message, add `Upload [Asset Type]: [Asset Name]`, check box for "create new merge request", name your merge request, and click "Upload file"
1. Add description to MR, complete the author checklist, assign to `@jgragnola` and click "Submit Merge Request"
1. In your Marketo program, for the `pdfVersion` My Token, add the naming convention above which will be available when the MR is merged. (the token should look like `https://about.gitlab.com/resources/downloads/add-file-name-here.pdf`)
