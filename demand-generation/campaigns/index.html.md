| Q4FY21 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Q1FY22 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Q2FY22 | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Currently WIP to break down geo-specific MQL targets.
_Targets are derived from [Approved Second Half FY21-22 Segment Marketing Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4EmaoSb35d8ZnjKags1gUGF5T9afJW6RhBO8TR_VgA/edit#slide=id.p4) (GitLab internal team members may view this information)._

### Q3 OKRs
{: #okrs}

**OKRs = Objective + Key Result**

- **Objective:** Meet/Exceed outbound Marketing Qualified Leads ([MQL]) (/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#lead-scoring-lead-lifecycle-and-mql-criteria) generation targets

    - TBD

[See Epic >](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1309)

### FY21-22 First Principles
{: #first-principles}

1. **Find new accounts** to add to the target pool (paid demand gen)
1. **Offer compelling ungated content journeys** that drive to proven web CTAs
1. **Appropriately nurture our database** (of inbound inquiries, free .com users, core users, customers)

## Team Structure
{: #team-structure .gitlab-purple}

The Campaigns Team is aligned to sales segments with a geo breakout. Our number one focus is driving outbound MQLs, while collaborating across marketing (working closely with field marketing, sales, and SDRs in region) to develop strategies contributing to SAOs and closed won revenue against target accounts.

## Communication
{: #communication .gitlab-purple}

In line with GitLab's overall [communication guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/), campaign managers work through MRs first and issues second (in order to preserve documentation), and our slack channel [#marketing_programs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCWUCP4MS) is used for team updated and quick questions.

The [#demand-gen](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CJFB4T7EX) channel is used for weekly check-ins and interaction with the larger demand generation team.

### Meeting Cadence
{: #meeting-cadence}

Most of our team meetings are recorded and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1GDkvqVhimLDnX744eh9YS6_qHhKRafmJ).

- Tuesdays - Campaign Team Connect Call (campaigns)
- Wednesdays - Demand Generation Team Call (campaigns, digital, partner)
- Thursdays - "No work talk" demand gen team hangout (campaigns, digital, partner)
- Thursdays - Marketing strategy & tactics call (all marketing)

### The Handbook
{: #handbook}

Is our single source of truth (SSoT) for processes and relevant links

- Individual teams should link back to these SSoT sections to avoid confusion
- Collaborative tactics contain their own handbook pages
- The handbook will be iterated on as we establish and optimize processes for optimal efficiency

## Project Management
{: #project-management .gitlab-purple}

### Turnaround Time and SLAs
{: #slas}

‚è± **The SLA (Service Level Agreement) - 5 business days - begins when all details (including 100% final copy) is provided in the issue.**
- Tip: Submit issues with full "Submitter Details" complete
- Tip: Bookmark a view of your issues in Blocked status ([example](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=mktg-status%3A%3Ablocked&assignee_username[]=jgragnola))

**Copy must be 100% final in order to be triaged.** This includes final edits for copy, grammar, sentence structure and readability, as well as review by relevant stakeholders (such as managers, product mktg, content mktg, sales, etc.

The issue requester is responsible for ensuring that appropriate `mktg-status` labels are applied to the issue (issue templates have the tags built in to assist).

**The due date applied when the issue is submitted is not final.** The [workback calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RvYLEUJvh9QZJZX1uXiKJPcOOSGd7dEeNneqyA2bt3A/edit#gid=969067029) is a guideline to assist your project planning, however if details are not provided in the issue 5 business days prior by requestor, the issue timeline will be at risk and likely to be pushed out.
  - If an issue due date is prior to the SLA (based on date "submitter details" were complete), the due date will be changed to meet the SLA timeline (5 BD from date of final details submitted)
  - For example, if the issue is submitted 0ct 1, with a due date of Oct 15, BUT details are not submitted until Oct 14, THEN the issue due date will be moved to Oct 21 by the triage manager.
  - The triage manager and assignee are the ONLY individuals allowed to adjust due dates upon triage.
  - üôè Please **do not** ask Campaign Managers to complete work in a shorter timeline as this is disruptive to their milestone, and their priority is to plan, implement, and optimize top-funnel campaigns and tactics. They will manage their milestones appropriately and pull in work as bandwidth allows, and based on the SLA.

### Issue Templates
{: #issue-templates}

We ask that teams request work using the following issue templates in the campaigns project. These templates more clearly indicate what information and details are required in order for the request to be triaged.

Note on timelines: The campaigns team is focused on top-funnel campaign strategy, execution, and optimization. Team member milestones include work to support top funnel goals as part of [Segment Marketing Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4EmaoSb35d8ZnjKags1gUGF5T9afJW6RhBO8TR_VgA/edit#slide=id.p4) and requests will be committed to as bandwidth permits. Please see section on [turnaround time & SLAs](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#slas).

#### Fundamental principles of issue requests
{: #fundamentals}

The following issue templates are used by the campaigns team to organize their work, with appropriate labels applied for project management.

- `/assign @` - issues should have only DRI based on who will complete the work in the issue. If work needs to be completed by multiple people, consider breaking into separate issues with clear deliverables and due dates. (example: `/assign @jgragnola`)
- `/due 2020-` - add due date based on workback schedules (example: `/due 2020-07-13` or `/due tomorrow` or `/due 07/13/2020`)
- `/milestone %` - add milestone based on the due date of the issue (example: `/milestone %"Mktg: ` )
- `/weight ` - add weight between 1-5, with 1 being easiest (between 1-4 hours of time) and 5 being most complext (a full week of work). The majority of issues should fall into 1-2. If estimation is weight of 3+, break into separate issues for more manageable pieces to fit into milestones. (example: `/weight 1`)
- `/epic ` - add epic of the overarching campaign or project to keep things organized. In almost all cases, there is a larger initiative that the issue relates to, so it is best practice to associate issues to the most relevant epic for visibility. (example: `/epic [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370)`)

### Campaigns Team Intake Process
{: #intake-process}

Beginning Q3 FY21, the demand gen campaigns team will begin an issue intake process to evaluate comprehensive details of request and assign based on milestone bandwidth and priorities. Requests may be submitted using the correct issue templates.

Issues will be triaged as demonstrated in the diagram below. Please note: All required details in a given issue template must be completed in order for the SLA timeline to begin.

<div style="width: 600px;" class="embed-thumb"> <div style="position: relative; height: 0;overflow: hidden; height: 400px; max-width: 800px; min-width: 320px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: #d8d8d8;"> <div style="position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;z-index: 10; width: 600px; height: 100%;background: url(https://murally.blob.core.windows.net/thumbnails/gitlab2474/murals/gitlab2474.1598468466093-5f46b1720e54f644475491fc-61c7931a-18e2-4a73-90dd-eafcb724b939.png?v=27e40478-1cf5-43f3-8970-f6d66232a7d1) no-repeat center center; background-size: cover;"> <div style="position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;z-index: 20;width: 100%; height: 100%;background-color: white;-webkit-filter: opacity(.4);"> </div> <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1598468466093/3fecfe10c92a0e8b26403fe8e44305c6049185e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="transform: translate(-50%, -50%);top: 50%;left: 50%; position: absolute; z-index: 30; border: none; display: block; height: 50px; background: transparent;"> <img src="https://app.mural.co/static/images/btn-enter-mural.svg" alt="ENTER THE MURAL" width="233" height="50"> </a> </div> </div> <p style="margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 60px;line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;font-family: Proxima Nova, sans-serif;font-weight: 400; color: #888888;"> You will enter this mural in View Only mode. </p></div>

#### Intake process labels
{: #intake-labels}

- **mktg-status::triage** - the issue will be evaluated to determine if full details are included, and ask questions as needed if the scope/details are not clear
- **mktg-status::blocked** - there were insufficient details in the issue for work to be triaged
    - The requester must provide the details and then move the status back to `mktg-status::triage` in order for the request to be reviewed again.
    - Please note: issue submission does not begin the SLA timeline; sufficient details begin the SLA timeline. [see note about turnaround time and SLAs](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#slas)
- **mktg-status::wip** - the issue is assigned and moved into appropriate time-based milestone
- **mktg-status::plan** - this is used for work that is in an earlier stage of planning and a specific request has not been made
    - This will likely be used mainly by campaign managers on issues that are not high priority but there is a desire to capture the idea/notes.

#### Intake process daily/weekly steps
{: #intake-steps}

Team manager completes daily review of [issues in triage](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1919630?&label_name%5B%5D=Marketing%20Programs) assessing the following standards:
* Are all details in the `Submitter Checklist` sufficiently complete in order to begin work?
  - if yes, check that due date is at least 5 business days from date submitter details provided, move to `mktg-status::wip`, assign based on triage diagram, and put in current milestone (to be adjusted as needed by assignee)
  - if no, comment to requester and move to `mktg-status::blocked` with reminder that SLA will begin when the details are submitted - [more details here](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#slas)
* Does the request align to FY21-22 segment marketing plan?
 - if no, consider realistic timeline given priorities (and share with requester in comments, set up time to discuss if needed)

#### Project management automation
{: #project-management-automation}

To be built out

#### Shortcut issue comments for project management
{: #shortcut-comments}

**When a team member is picking up an issue from the backlog:**

```
/label ~"mktg-status::wip" 
/assign @
/milestone %Mktg:
```

This will change the status to wip (work in progress), allow quick assignment and add to the appropriate milestone.

### Milestones
{: #milestones}

The campaigns team uses the overall 2-week marketing milestones (format of [Mktg: YYYY-MM-DD](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_title=mktg%3A+&state=&sort=)) to organize, prioritize, and balance campaigns, projects, and requests.

- The date in the milestone name is the END date of miltesone (Sunday)
- Note: Use of milestones was introduced to the campaigns team as of 2020-07-21.
- If issues in a milestone are not closed out by end of milestone, they are pulled to the next milestone. We will document **total issues** and **total weight** moved, to understand relative commitment levels and avoid overcommitment as we begin using milestones.

**Q3 FY21 Marketing Milestones:**

- [Mktg: 2020-08-02](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones/224)
- [Mktg: 2020-08-16](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones/225)

### Tips & Tricks
{: #tips-tricks}

#### Creating a MacBook shortcut for repetitive statements
{: #macbook-shortcuts}

**Example:** in an issue to update all of MPM, instead of typing out every name, I have added a shortcut in my computer to populate all of the MPMs GitLab handles when I type `asdf + Enter`.

**How to:**

- On your Mac, choose Apple menu (ever-present top left logo)
- Go to `System Preferences`
- Click the `Keyboard` section
- Click `Text` on the top nav options
- Cick the `+` at the bottom of the option list
- In `Replace` column, add the shortcut that you would type in to populate the repetitive text
- In `With` column, add the repetitive text that you want to populate when you type in the shortcut

## Integrated campaigns reporting
{: #demand-gen-dash .gitlab-purple}

Demand Generation uses Sisense dashboards to report on integrated campaigns performance, specifically:

1. [Demand Gen Overview Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/631669/WIP:-Agnes-Oetama-IC-Dashboard): 
This dashboard provides quick insights on campaign performance and monitors the impacts of campaign optimizations on various funnel metrics over the life of the campaign.
2. [Demand Gen Table Summary](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/665451/WIP:-Agnes-IC-Campaign-Table-Summary): This dashboard measures and compares the performance of integrated campaigns and channels within each campaign.

The Integrated Campaigns dashboards use [Bizible touchpoints](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible/#bizible-touchpoints) to track Inquiries, MQLs, and SDR Accepted metrics. We use the [Linear Bizible Attribution touchpoints model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible/#linear-attribution) to track Opportunities, Total IACV$, SAO, Pipeline IACV$, Won Deals count, and Won IACV $.

These dashboards were created by @aoetama and she is in the process of building out additional functionalities outlined in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/629).

#### Drilling down into the dashboards
{: #dashboard-drilldowns}

One of the dashboard functionalities that will be built out is the ability to drill into SFDC records that make up each chart/table.  

In the interim, here are example SFDC reports mirroring the Sisense dashboards which can be used when needing to deep dive into SFDC record details.

`Please do not overwrite the example reports. Instead, clone and tweak the filters accordingly to the desired campaign landing page and utms.`

- **[Campaign Inquiries by channel path](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aNan):** Using the VC&C campaign as an example, this report tells you which channels (Paid Search, Display, Organic Search, Paid Social) sub channels (Paid Search.AdWords,Organic Search.Bing,Organic Search.Google, Paid Social.Facebook,Paid Social.LinkedIn) drove inquries to your campaign.
- **[Campaign Inquiries by offer](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aSST):** Using the VC&C campaign as an example, this report tells you the offers (form submit landing page url) that drove inquries to your campaign.


## Offer-Specific Dashboards
{: #dashboard-by-offer}

SFDC reports and dashboards to track program performance real-time. Data from the below SFDC reports/dashboards along with anecdotal feedback gathered during program retros will be used as guidelines for developing and growing various marketing campaigns.

The SFDC report/dashboard is currently grouped by program types so MPMs can easily compare and identify top performing and under performing programs within the areas that they are responsible for.

### Key Metrics tracked on ALL virtual events dashboards
{: #dashboard-virtual-events}

*Note: Virtual Events include Webcast, Live Demos and Virtual Sponsorship*

* **Total Registration :** The number of people that registered for the virtual event regardless whether they attend or not.
* **Total Attendance:** The number of people that attended the LIVE virtual event (exclude people who watched the on-demand version).
* **Attendance Rate:** % of people that attended the LIVE virtual event out of the total registered (i.e: Total Attendance / Total Registration).
* **Net New Names:** The number of net new names added to our marketing database driven by the virtual event. Because a net new person record may be inserted into our CRM (SFDC) as a lead or a contact object therefore, we need to add `Total net new leads` and `Total net new contacts` to get the overall total net new names.
* **Influenced Pipe:** Total New and Add-on business pipeline IACV$ influenced by people who attended the LIVE virtual event. The webcast and live demo dashboards currently use SFDC out of the box `Campaigns with Influenced opportunities` report type because Bizible was implemented in June'18 and therefore the attribution report did not capture data prior to this. We plan to migrate webcast and live demo influenced pipe reports to Bizible attribution report in the next dashboard iteration so they align with overall marketing reporting.

#### Virtual Events Reporting
{: #reporting-virtual-events}

The [Webcast Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z6100000079e6) tracks all webcasts hosted on GitLab's internal webcast platform. It is organized into 3 columns. The left and middle columns tracks 2 different webcast series (Release Radar vs. CI/CD webcast series). The right column tracks various one-off webcasts since Jan'18.

The [Live Demo Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z6100000079f4) is organized into 2 columns. The left column tracks the bi-weekly Enterprise Edition product demos (1 hour duration). The bi-weekly Enterprise Edition product demos ran between Q1'18 - Q2'18.
The right column tracks the weekly high level product demo + Q&A session (30 minutes duration). The weekly high level product demo + Q&A session was launched in Q4'18 and currently running through the end of Feb 2019.

The [Virtual Sponsorship Dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01Z61000000UD44) focuses on events that are hosted by a 3rd party where GitLab has purchased a virtual booth or sponsorship.
