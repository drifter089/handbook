## Communication
{: #communication .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

In line with GitLab's overall [communication guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/), campaign managers work through MRs first and issues second (in order to preserve documentation), and our slack channel [#marketing_programs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCWUCP4MS) is used for team updated and quick questions.

The [#demand-gen](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CJFB4T7EX) channel is used for weekly check-ins and interaction with the larger demand generation team.

In between bi-weekly Campaigns Team Connect calls:
* **Updates** should be added to MRs when possible
   - Add to #marketing_programs Slack
   - Begin with `UPDATE: <brief description>` (i.e. `UPDATE: Marketo segmentation live for sales segment`)
   - Include link to MR (preferred) or issue
* **Topics** that need input should be added as an MR when possible, with issues as a secondary option, and pinged in Slack with `DISCUSS`
   - Add to #marketing_programs Slack
   - Begin with `DISCUSS: <brief description>` (i.e. `DISCUSS: Marketing tool champions`)
   - Include link to MR (preferred) or issue

### Meeting Cadence
{: #meeting-cadence}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Most of our team meetings are recorded and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1GDkvqVhimLDnX744eh9YS6_qHhKRafmJ).

- Bi-weekly Tuesdays - Campaign Team Connect Call (campaigns)
- Bi-weekly Wednesdays - Demand Generation Team Call (campaigns, digital, partner)
- Thursdays - "No work talk" demand gen team hangout (campaigns, digital, partner)
- Thursdays - Marketing strategy & tactics call (all marketing)

### The Handbook
{: #handbook}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Is our single source of truth (SSoT) for processes and relevant links

- Individual teams should link back to these SSoT sections to avoid confusion
- Collaborative tactics contain their own handbook pages
- The handbook will be iterated on as we establish and optimize processes for optimal efficiency

## Project Management
{: #project-management .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->


### Prioiritization
{: #prioritization-boards}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

1. [Campaigns Team - Prioritization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/-/boards/2532209?&label_name[]=mktg-demandgen)
   - Do: at start of milestone, ensure that issues are in the proper category of prioritization. Align them to the [priority definitions](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#prioritization-labels).
   - Do: consider the time you have available in a 2 week period, recognizing meeting commitments and planned PTO.
   - Do: only add issues to account for 70% of your available work hours. Don't max out at 100% since there will likely be things that arise and need immediate attention throughout milestone.
   - *Ask yourself: considering realistic time this milestone, am I overcommitting? The first to drop from a milestone should be "Low" priority issues based on [definitions](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#prioritization-labels).*
   - Discuss milestone with Jackie and if need help determining what to drop and how to communicate (potentially) to issue requestors.
1. [Campaigns Team - Current Milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/-/boards/2574635?milestone_title=%23started&)
   - Do: minimize the "Low" and "Medium" columns. Your focus should first be on the "Top" and "High" priority issues.
   - Do: prioritize completion of "Top" priority issues, then "High" priority issues.

### Labels
{: #labels}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

#### Prioritization labels
{: #prioritization-labels}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

- `DG-Priority::Top`: Immediate action needed, aligned to OKRs, GTM motions/sales plays, or segment/region MQL generation. This category will be limited because not everything can be a priority. Timeframe: Immediate action needed.
- `DG-Priority::High`: Not requiring immediate action, but aligned to OKRs, GTM motions/sales plays, or segment/region MQL generation. Timeframe: Within weeks.
- `DG-Priority::Med`: Requests submitted that align to OKRs, GTM motions/sales plays, or segment/region plans. Process improvements to fix broken processes, or improve campaign team efficiency. Timeframe: Within months.
- `DG-Priority::Low`: Requests submitted that would be helpful, but can be pushed for higher priority issues. Nice-to-have improvements for campaign team processes. Timeframe: No specific timeline.
- `DG-Priority::ToBePrioritized`: Requests that have not yet been prioritized by Demand Gen.

#### Team labels
{: #team-labels}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

* `mktg-demandgen`: DRI is in Demand Gen team
* `dg-campaigns`: DRI is in Campaigns team
* `dg-request`: Issue requesting Demand Gen support (did not originate from DRI team)

#### Status labels
{: #intake-labels}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

- `mktg-status::triage`: the issue will be evaluated to determine if full details are included, and ask questions as needed if the scope/details are not clear
- `mktg-status::blocked`: there were insufficient details in the issue for work to be triaged
    - The requester must provide the details and then move the status back to `mktg-status::triage` in order for the request to be reviewed again.
    - Please note: issue submission does not begin the SLA timeline; sufficient details begin the SLA timeline. [see note about turnaround time and SLAs](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#slas)
- `mktg-status::wip`: the issue is assigned and moved into appropriate time-based milestone
- `mktg-status::plan`: this is used for work that is in an earlier stage of planning and a specific request has not been made
    - This will likely be used mainly by campaign managers on issues that are not high priority but there is a desire to capture the idea/notes.


### Turnaround Time and SLAs
{: #slas}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**NOTE: this section will be retired (and communicated). Prioritization of activities aligned to demand generation goals, and consideration against current and planned milestones and projects, will take precedence over a time-based requirement to complete work. The [Marketing Campaign Manager role](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/marketing/marketing-campaign-manager/) requires focus on top-funnel lead generation, and new issues will be reviewed against workload and prioritized accordingly.**

⏱ **The SLA (Service Level Agreement) - 5 business days - begins when all details (including 100% final copy) is provided in the issue.**
- Tip: Submit issues with full "Submitter Details" complete
- Tip: Bookmark a view of your issues in Blocked status ([example](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=mktg-status%3A%3Ablocked&assignee_username[]=jgragnola))

**Copy must be 100% final in order to be triaged.** This includes final edits for copy, grammar, sentence structure and readability, as well as review by relevant stakeholders (such as managers, product mktg, content mktg, sales, etc.

The issue requester is responsible for ensuring that appropriate `mktg-status` labels are applied to the issue (issue templates have the tags built in to assist).

**The due date applied when the issue is submitted is not final.** The [workback calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RvYLEUJvh9QZJZX1uXiKJPcOOSGd7dEeNneqyA2bt3A/edit#gid=969067029) is a guideline to assist your project planning, however if details are not provided in the issue 5 business days prior by requestor, the issue timeline will be at risk and likely to be pushed out.
  - If an issue due date is prior to the SLA (based on date "submitter details" were complete), the due date will be changed to meet the SLA timeline (5 BD from date of final details submitted)
  - For example, if the issue is submitted 0ct 1, with a due date of Oct 15, BUT details are not submitted until Oct 14, THEN the issue due date will be moved to Oct 21 by the triage manager.
  - The triage manager and assignee are the ONLY individuals allowed to adjust due dates upon triage.
  - 🙏 Please **do not** ask Campaign Managers to complete work in a shorter timeline as this is disruptive to their milestone, and their priority is to plan, implement, and optimize top-funnel campaigns and tactics. They will manage their milestones appropriately and pull in work as bandwidth allows, and based on the SLA.

### Issue Templates
{: #issue-templates}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

We ask that teams request work using the following issue templates in the campaigns project. These templates more clearly indicate what information and details are required in order for the request to be triaged.

Note on timelines: The campaigns team is focused on top-funnel campaign strategy, execution, and optimization. Team member milestones include work to support top funnel goals as part of [Segment Marketing Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4EmaoSb35d8ZnjKags1gUGF5T9afJW6RhBO8TR_VgA/edit#slide=id.p4) and requests will be committed to as bandwidth permits. Please see section on [turnaround time & SLAs](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#slas).

#### Fundamental principles of issue requests
{: #fundamentals}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

The following issue templates are used by the campaigns team to organize their work, with appropriate labels applied for project management.

- `/assign @` - issues should have only DRI based on who will complete the work in the issue. If work needs to be completed by multiple people, consider breaking into separate issues with clear deliverables and due dates. (example: `/assign @jgragnola`)
- `/due 2020-` - add due date based on workback schedules (example: `/due 2020-07-13` or `/due tomorrow` or `/due 07/13/2020`)
- `/milestone %` - add milestone based on the due date of the issue (example: `/milestone %"Mktg: ` )
- `/weight ` - add weight between 1-5, with 1 being easiest (between 1-4 hours of time) and 5 being most complext (a full week of work). The majority of issues should fall into 1-2. If estimation is weight of 3+, break into separate issues for more manageable pieces to fit into milestones. (example: `/weight 1`)
- `/epic ` - add epic of the overarching campaign or project to keep things organized. In almost all cases, there is a larger initiative that the issue relates to, so it is best practice to associate issues to the most relevant epic for visibility. (example: `/epic [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370)`)

### Campaigns Team Intake Process
{: #intake-process}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Beginning Q3 FY21, the demand gen campaigns team will begin an issue intake process to evaluate comprehensive details of request and assign based on milestone bandwidth and priorities. Requests may be submitted using the correct issue templates.

Issues will be triaged as demonstrated in the diagram below. Please note: All required details in a given issue template must be completed in order for the SLA timeline to begin.

#### Intake process daily/weekly steps
{: #intake-steps}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Team manager completes daily review of [issues in triage](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1919630?&label_name%5B%5D=Marketing%20Programs) assessing the following standards:
* Are all details in the `Submitter Checklist` sufficiently complete in order to begin work?
  - if yes, check that due date is at least 5 business days from date submitter details provided, move to `mktg-status::wip`, assign based on triage diagram, and put in current milestone (to be adjusted as needed by assignee)
  - if no, comment to requester and move to `mktg-status::blocked` with reminder that SLA will begin when the details are submitted - [more details here](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#slas)
* Does the request align to FY21-22 segment marketing plan?
 - if no, consider realistic timeline given priorities (and share with requester in comments, set up time to discuss if needed)

#### Project management automation
{: #project-management-automation}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

To be built out

#### Shortcut issue comments for project management
{: #shortcut-comments}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**When a team member is picking up an issue from the backlog:**

```
/label ~"mktg-status::wip" 
/assign @
/milestone %Mktg:2021-
```

This will change the status to wip (work in progress), allow quick assignment and add to the appropriate milestone.

### Milestones
{: #milestones}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

The campaigns team uses the overall 2-week marketing milestones (format of [Mktg: YYYY-MM-DD](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_title=mktg%3A+&state=&sort=)) to organize, prioritize, and balance campaigns, projects, and requests.

- The date in the milestone name is the END date of miltesone (Sunday)
- Note: Use of milestones was introduced to the campaigns team as of 2020-07-21.
- If issues in a milestone are not closed out by end of milestone, they are pulled to the next milestone. We will document **total issues** and **total weight** moved, to understand relative commitment levels and avoid overcommitment as we begin using milestones.

**Q3 FY21 Marketing Milestones:**

- [Mktg: 2021-02-14](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones/238)
- [Mktg: 2021-02-28](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones/239)

#### Creating a MacBook shortcut for repetitive statements
{: #macbook-shortcuts}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**Example:** in an issue to update all of MPM, instead of typing out every name, I have added a shortcut in my computer to populate all of the MPMs GitLab handles when I type `asdf + Enter`.

**How to:**

- On your Mac, choose Apple menu (ever-present top left logo)
- Go to `System Preferences`
- Click the `Keyboard` section
- Click `Text` on the top nav options
- Cick the `+` at the bottom of the option list
- In `Replace` column, add the shortcut that you would type in to populate the repetitive text
- In `With` column, add the repetitive text that you want to populate when you type in the shortcut
