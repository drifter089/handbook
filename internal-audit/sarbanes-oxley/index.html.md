## Purpose

To develop a formalized system of checks and balances, thereby helping protect GitLab stakeholders from fraudulant financial reporting.
<br>

## Scope

Currently [ Sarbanes- Oxley (SOX) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act) regulations do not apply to GitLab. As part of GitLab's [public company readiness](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/being-a-public-company/#public-company-readiness) milestone, we are in the process of implementing a SOX program.  

GitLab has adopted the [COSO framework](https://www.coso.org/Pages/ic.aspx) as the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting.
