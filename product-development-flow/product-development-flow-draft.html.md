## Overview & philosophy

GitLab's product mission is to consistently create products and experiences that users love and
value. To deliver on this mission, it's important to have a clearly defined and repeatable flow for
turning an idea into something that offers customer value. Note that it's also important to allow
open source contributions at any point in the process from the wider GitLab community - these won't
necessarily follow this process.

This page is an evolving description of how we expect our cross-functional development teams to work, and reflects the current process being used. All required steps in this development flow are denoted as follows:

> <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Denotes a required aspect of the product development workflow.

Feature development is expected to pass through all required phases, while the rest of the development flow should be considered a set of best practices and tools to aid with completing these phases.

The goal is to have this page be the single source of truth, but it will take time to eliminate duplication elsewhere in the handbook. In the meantime, whenever there are conflicts, this page takes precedence.

Because this page needs to be concise and consistent, be sure to follow the prescribed [change process](#editing-this-page).

## But Wait, Isn't This Waterfall?

No. Although the phases described on this page appear to be independent and linear, they're not. They're presented for simplicity and ease of navigation. It's common to iterate through the Validation phases multiple times before moving to Build. During the Build phases, it may be necessary to go back to Validation phases as roadblocks or technical challenges arise.

## Workflow Summary

</object>

> <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Workflow labels must be applied for each phase that's used to enable tracking and collaboration across teams.

### Issue descriptions as the SSOT

> <i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Issue descriptions shall always be maintained as the single source of truth.

It's not [efficient](/handbook/values/#efficiency) for contributors to need to read every comment in an issue to understand the current state.

* When transitioning an issue out to a new workflow stage, the department named in the "Who Transitions Out" column is responsible for updating the issue description.

## Validation track

For new ideas where the customer problem and solution isn't well understood, Product Managers (PMs) and the User Experience Department (UXers) should work together to validate new opportunities before moving to the Build track. The **Validation** track is an independent track from the always moving **Build** track. PMs and UXers should work together to get one to two months ahead, so that the Build track always has well-validated product opportunities ready to start. Milestone work should be prioritized with the understanding that some milestones may include more validation efforts than others. Validation cycles may not be necessary for things like bug fixes, well understood iterative improvements, minor design fixes, and technical debt.

### Validation Goals & Outcomes

**When:** When our confidence about the proposed problem or solution isn't high. For example, if we aren't reasonably sure that the problem is important to a significant number of users, or that the solution is easy to understand and use.

**Who:** Product Manager, Product Designer, UX Research, Engineering Manager

**What:**

✅ **Understand** the user problem we are trying to solve.

✅ **Identify** business goals and key metrics to determine success.

✅ **Generate** hypotheses and research/experiment/user-test.

✅ **Define** MVC and potential future iterations.

✅ **Minimize** risks to value, usability, feasibility, and business viability with qualitative and quantitative analysis.

**Outcome:** We have confidence that a proposed solution will positively impact one or more [Product KPIs](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/kpi-index/#product-kpis). There may be reason for exceptions, so the team would need to be clear in that case, and be able to justify that it's still important without mapping back to our KPIs.

If we don't have confidence in the MVC or what success looks like, we should continue validation cycles before we move to the Build track.

### Validation phase 1: Validation backlog

<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Label: `workflow::validation backlog`

#### Key Participants

| Role          | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| DRI           | Product Manager |
| Collaborators | Product Designer <br/>Engineering Manager |
| Informed      | Customers <br/>Technical Account Manager <br/>Product Marketing Manager <br/>Other [stakeholders](/handbook/product/product-processes/#whats-a-stakeholder) as appropriate |

#### Description

The growth of a world class product is built from a well maintained backlog. Product Managers are responsible for refining a group's backlog to ensure validation opportunities are scoped and [prioritized](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization) in line with category direction and stage or section level strategy. The backlog is also the single source of truth for [stakeholders](/handbook/product/product-processes/#whats-a-stakeholder) to understand and engage with your group. An issue position in the backlog, along with the description, discussion, and metadata on those issues are key pieces of data necessary to keep stakeholders up to date.

#### Outcomes and Activities

|----------|------------|-----|
| <i aria-hidden="true" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw"></i>**Up to date issues and epics**: At GitLab, issues are the single source of truth for any change to the product. Keeping these up to date increases efficiency and transparency by allowing all team members to understand the planned work. | - Create issues in response to a [sensing mechanism](/handbook/product/product-processes/#sensing-mechanisms). Consider using the _Problem Validation_ issue template for new features. <br/>- Review issue discussions and update relevant info in the description. <br/>- Keep metadata (such as labels) up-to-date. <br/>- Actively respond to stakeholder comments. <br/>- Transfer discussion notes, and external information to the issue (as links or discussion/description details). | Product Manager |

### Validation phase 2: Problem validation

<i class="fab fa-gitlab fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:1.25em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Label: `workflow::problem validation`

#### Key Participants

| Role          | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| DRI           | Product Manager |
| Collaborators | UX Researcher |
| Informed      | Product Designer <br/>Engineering Team <br/>Other [stakeholders](/handbook/product/product-processes/#whats-a-stakeholder) as appropriate |


#### Description

To ensure the right solutions are delivered, the team must start their work with a [validated problem](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/problem-validation-and-methods/#what-is-problem-validation). This can take [many forms](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/problem-validation-and-methods/#different-problem-validation-research-methods) and be achieved through Product Manager and UX Researcher collaboration.

If the problem is small and well-understood, it may be possible to quickly move through this phase by documenting the known data about the user problem.

If the problem is nuanced, then it will likely take longer to validate with users properly. This phase's primary outcome is a clear understanding of the problem, along with a simple and clear way to communicate the problem to various stakeholders. Although optional, it is recommended to use an [Opportunity Canvas](/handbook/product/product-processes/#opportunity-canvas) as a tool that helps individuals better understand a problem, and communicate it to various stakeholders.

#### Outcomes and Activities

Consider scheduling a review to gather feedback and communicate the findings to Product and UX leadership. | Product Manager |

### Validation phase 3: Design

| Informed      | Other [stakeholders](/handbook/product/product-processes/#whats-a-stakeholder) as appropriate |

#### Description

After understanding and validating the problem, we can begin or continue to ideate potential solutions through a [diverge/converge](http://web.stanford.edu/~rldavis/educ236/readings/doet/text/ch06_excerpt.html) process.

The Product Designer leads the team (Product Manager, Engineering, UX Researcher, Software Engineers in Test, and Technical Writers, as needed, depending on the item) in ideating potential solutions and exploring different approaches (diverge) before converging on a single solution. Product Managers and Engineers evaluate solutions by determining if they meet customer and business goals, and are technically feasible. The team is encouraged to engage with stakeholders to determine potential flaws, missed use cases, and if the solution has the intended customer impact. After the team converges on the proposed solution or identifies a small set of options to validate, the issue moves into the Solution Validation phase.

To start the Design phase, the Product Designer or Product Manager applies the `workflow::design` label to an existing issue or, if needed, creates a new issue with this label.

#### Description

After identifying one more potential solutions that meet business needs and are technically feasible, the Product Manager and Product Designer must ensure that we have confidence that the proposed solution will meet the user's needs and expectations. This confidence can be obtained from work performed during the design phase and supplemented with additional research (including user interviews, usability testing, or solution validation). If necessary, this phase will launch a Solution Validation issue within the [GitLab UX Research project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research) which will walk the team through research to validate their proposed solution(s).

To start the Solution Validation phase, the Product Designer or Product Manager applies the `workflow::solution validation` label to an existing issue.

## Review track (optional*)

The (iteration) Review track is an **optional step** in the flow that brings peer PMs in to help
you hone your skills at _iteration_, _clarity_, and _strategy_. Keeping issues small and iterative
is core to how GitLab maintains [velocity](/handbook/engineering/#the-importance-of-velocity),
writing a "small" issue is often (counterintuitively) more difficult than writing a bigger one, and
understanding the _entire strategy_ of how GitLab operates is a herculean task. Having a helping
hand with these tasks is important to professional development, and it ensures that our entire
Product organization continues to improve.

You should consider requesting a review when:

1. You're having specific challenges defining the problem, identifying the affected personas, or breaking down the solution to small chunks of work.
1. There are potential design or technical dependencies across Sections, Stages, or Groups.
1. This issue takes the product in a novel direction or adds functionality unlike anything else in the product

_*Note: **If you're a new GitLab team member**, you should request reviews of the first 3 issues you create. It will help familiarize you with what we're looking for in an iteration, get more comfortable with our process, and meet your fellow team members. After you've completed a few reviews, this track can be considered optional._

If you would like a peer to review one of your issues (or epics):

1. Add the `issue::needs review` label to your issue
1. Post a link to the issue in the [**#issue-reviews**](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CSX3RHE4C) channel in Slack
   1. _Note: If you need a review to be completed quickly, be sure to mention when it needs to be done by._
1. The issue gets picked up by a Reviewer PM, who adds a ✅ reaction on the Slack message.
1. Reviewer PM reads through the issue and leaves feedback on these criteria:
   1. **Iteration**: Has the solution been broken down as much as possible? Is it small enough to be completed in one milestone rather than spanning multiple milestones? Have implementation risks been considered and minimized?
   1. **Clarity**: Is the problem well versed and the personas identified? Could someone outside the group or category understand the issue? Is the value being delivered to the users articulated?
   1. **Strategy**: How will it work in GitLab as whole? Does it tie back to category strategy or stage direction?
1. Things for the reviewer to **not** do:
   1. Don't just _enforce the template_. Instead, give contextual feedback with the appropriate template as a reference point.
   1. Don't treat this as another task to check off, but instead, take this opportunity to engage in conversation and improve our organizations ability to iterate.
   1. Don't assume that the other PM will do exactly what you say. You're providing recommendations, not edicts.
1. When complete, the Reviewer PM adds the `issue::reviewed` label and lets the original PM know that the review is complete.

You can view all of the work happening in this track [on this board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1569699).

## Build track

The build track is where we plan, develop, and deliver value to our users by building [MVCs](/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc), fixing defects, patching security vulnerabilities, enhancing user experience, and improving performance. DRIs across engineering disciplines involving [Design, Backend, Frontend and Quality](/handbook/product/product-processes/#pm-em-ux-and-set-quad-dris) work closely together to implement MVCs while in close collaboration with the Product Manager. Decisions are made quickly if challenges arise. We instrument [usage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#instrument-tracking) and track [product performance](/handbook/product/product-processes/#product-metrics), so after MVCs are delivered to customers, feedback is captured quickly for learnings to refine the next iteration.

### Build Goals & Outcomes

**When:** As we build MVCs according to our [product development timeline](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline)

**Who:** Product Manager, Product Designer, Engineers, Software Engineers in Test

**What:**

✅ **Release** to a subset or full set of customers as appropriate.

✅ **Assess** UX, functional, technical performance, and customer impact.

✅ **Collect** data to measure MVC against success metrics to inform the next iteration.

✅ **Iterate** until success metrics are achieved and the product experience is optimal.

**Outcome:** Deliver performant MVCs that improve one or more of our [Product KPIs](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/kpi-index/#product-kpis) and/or [Engineering KPIs](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/kpi-index/#engineering-kpis). If it fails to do so, honor our Efficiency value (that includes a low level of shame), abandon it, and restart the validation cycle to identify the right solution.

#### Description

This phase prepares features so they are ready to be built by engineering. Bugs, technical debt, and other similar changes that are not features may enter the process in this phase (or may benefit from entering in earlier phases based on the cost of doing the work requiring the full problem to be validated to ensure it makes sense to do the work).  Following Validation Phase 4 the feature should already be broken down into the smallest possible iterations that add customer value, and be ready for a more detailed review by engineering (check out [iteration strategies](/handbook/product/product-processes/#iteration-strategies) for help). During this phase, Product Managers will surface issues they intend to prioritize for a milestone by applying the `workflow::planning breakdown` label. At this point, Engineering Managers will assign an engineer to further break down and apply weights to that work. This process is a collaboration between the DRI and Collaborators. Tradeoff decisions can be made and feature issues evolve from validation solutions to clear MVCs that can be delivered in a single milestone. Be sure to document all decisions on issues.

By reviewing and weighing work in the beginning of the Build Track, Product Managers are able to make better prioritization tradeoffs and engineering teams can ensure they've scoped the right amount of work for the milestone. If an issue enters the `workflow::planning breakdown` state it doesn't necessarily mean it will be prioritized in the next milestone, a Product Manager may make a tradeoff decision depending on capacity, and urgency.

Once work has passed the `workflow::planning breakdown` step, the `workflow::ready for development` label along with an upcoming milestone is applied to the issue. If an issue has been broken down, but not yet ready to pull into a milestone apply the `workflow::scheduling` label. Engineering Managers will apply `Deliverable` label to issues with a milestone and marked `workflow::ready for development` signaling acceptance of the issue for that milestone. This process occurs at the [beginning of milestone planning](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline). 

To ensure that a Software Engineer in Test (SET) will have ample time to contribute to new features, [Quad Planning](/handbook/engineering/quality/quad-planning/) is triggered automatically when an issue is in `workflow::ready for development` and a milestone is applied. The Quad Planning approach is triggered only in groups where a SET is assigned as the Quality team grows to their [desired ratio](/handbook/engineering/quality/#staffing-planning).

#### Key Participants

| Role          | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| DRI           | Assigned engineer |

| Informed      | Product Marketing <br/>Engineering Manager <br/>Cross-stage PM <br/>Sales <br/>Customer Support |

#### Description

The develop and test phase is where we build the features, address bugs or technical debt and test the solutions before launching them. The PM is directly responsible for prioritizing **what** should be worked on; however, the engineering manager and software engineers are responsible for the implementation of the feature using the [engineering workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#basics). Engineering owns the [definition of done](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done) and issues are not moved into the next phase until those requirements are met. Keep in mind that many team members are likely to contribute to a single issue and collaboration is key.

This phase begins after work has been broken down, and prioritized in Phase 1. Work is completed in priority order as set at the beginning of the milestone. The Engineering Manager will assign an issue to an engineer who is responsible for building the feature. An engineer can also self-serve and pick up the next priority order issue from the `workflow::ready for development` queue on their team's board. That engineer will update its `workflow::` label to indicate where it's position in the [development process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#basics).

When an issue is in development the Software Engineer in Test ([SET](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/#stable-counterparts)) will ensure the [quad planning](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/quad-planning/#process) process is being followed regarding test plans, regression jobs, end to end tests, etc. Coordination is key between the assigned development engineer and the SET during this phase.

Documentation for the work will be developed by the engineer and the Technical Writer, and the Technical Writer should review the documentation as part of the development process. Items discovered during a documentation review should not block issues moving into the next phase, and may drive the creation of follow-on improvement MRs for the documentation, after release.

*Note: Work deemed out-of-scope or incomplete by engineering is taken back into the [plan phase](#build-phase-1-plan) for refinement and rescheduling for completion.*

### Build phase 3: Launch

Label: `workflow::production` (The production label is recommended but not required at this phase because issues may have valid reason to close with differing labels)

Issue Status: `Closed`

#### Key Participants

| Role          | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| DRI           | **Development**: Close issue after it's available in production. <br/>**Product Manager**: Initiate [release post item creation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator) if they decide it's warranted. <br/>**Product Manager**: Initiate [dogfooding process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#dogfooding-process) if they decide it's applicable. <br/>**Product Manager**: Consider alerting relevant stakeholders in appropriate Slack channels. |
| Collaborators | Development team, Quality counterpart, and Product Manager may verify the feature is working as expected in production. (Primary verification is, of course, performed prior to production whenever possible.) <br/>-Technical Writers create any documentation issues or MRs required to address issues identified during review that weren't resolved. |
| Informed      | [Stakeholders](/handbook/product/product-processes/#whats-a-stakeholder) for the change (including customers, open-source users, and GitLab team members) will be informed about the feature by the change in the status of the issue or the release post. GitLab team members may also be informed by posts in relevant Slack channels. |

#### Description

When the change becomes available in production, the issue is closed by the development team so stakeholders know work on it has been completed. Afterward, the Product Manager coordinates the [release post](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/) and [dogfooding process](/handbook/product/product-processes/#dogfooding-process) when they apply.

### Build phase 4: Improve

Label: n/a

#### Key Participants

| Role          | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| DRI           | Product Manager |
| Collaborators | Product Designer <br/>Customer Success <br/>Sales <br/>Data Analysts <br/>UX Researcher <br/>Product Marketing <br/>Technical Writing |
| Informed      | Engineering Team <br/>Leadership<br/>Other [stakeholders](/handbook/product/product-processes/#whats-a-stakeholder) as appropriate |

#### Description

After launch, the Product Manager and Product Designer should pay close attention to product usage data. This starts by ensuring your [AMAU](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#action-monthly-active-users-amau) is instrumented and reporting as you expect. From there consider how the feature has impacted [GMAU](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#group-monthly-active-users-gmau) and [SMAU](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#stage-monthly-active-users-smau). At this point you should also solicit customer feedback to guide follow-on iterative improvements, until success metrics are achieved/exceeded and a decision can be made that the product experience is sufficient. To create a combined and ongoing quantitative and qualitative feedback loop, consideration of the outcomes and potential activiies below are recommended.
