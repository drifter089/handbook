## Executive Summary

TeamOps is how GitLab works – it is an operating model that helps teams maximize productivity, flexibility, and autonomy by managing decisions, information, and tasks more efficiently. 

In FY2024, the Workplace department in GitLab will:
- Internally optimize workforce awareness and universal application of the TeamOps model 
- Externally monetize and market the TeamOps model through corporate training services 


## Growth

The future of TeamOps as an internal operational and as a revenue model is based on the following principles. (See also: [Workplace Handbook](/handbook/ceo/chief-of-staff-team/workplace/), [TeamOps Handbook](/handbook/teamops/)) 
- TeamOps is an evolution of the Managing So Everyone Can Contribute (MECC) management model. It is based on the philosophy of using information to stay aligned, instead of shared time or location (proximity). 
- TeamOps is **not** exclusively for remote work or distributed teams, but it does enable more schedule and workplace flexibility for every team structure. 
- TeamOps is a critical bridge between GitLab’s past ([DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/)) and future ([AllOps](https://about.gitlab.com/company/vision/#vision)). 
- The market diversification and project management messaging of TeamOps will create a runway for [AllOps rollout](https://about.gitlab.com/company/cadence/#example-of-cadence-flow).
- TeamOps sets the stage for information management to be the essential foundation of team success, then AllOps will becomes that information management system.
- The easiest, leanest short-term revenue opportunity for TeamOps is corporate training workshops. These services have high overhead and deliverycosts, but short/simple development and sales cycles. 

**What is Workplace Doing in FY24?**
- Maintain innovation, optimization, and evangelism of GitLab’s virtual workplace experience strategies 
- Standardize, optimize, evangelize and monetize GitLab’s ways of working (TeamOps) to equalize employee experience
- Monetize the TeamOps model with the yearly goal of breaking even 
- Explore TeamOps integration with GitLab (the tool). (ie: Using TeamOps research to inform UX updates that strengthen ease of use and prepare for market diversification; use GitLab metrics for TeamOps success measurement, etc.)

**Changes from FY23 Roadmap**
- Changing the original enrollment goal (100k learners) to a revenue goal (breakeven/$200k)
- Deprioritizing All-Remote evangelism to boost TeamOps (messaging about how we work instead of where we work)
- Workshops will be the first revenue stream, instead of the LevelUp course (due to higher per-customer profitability and lower marketing costs)
- Department will run lean with minimal hiring (decreasing headcount from 3-5 to 0-2)
- Existing resources will be tapped to (ie: internal brand team for graphic design, internal customer support and customer success for lead generation, internal L&D for facilitator training, partnership with McKinsey for affiliate sales, etc.) 
- Postpone high-level TeamOps marketing campaign and new content development to FY25 (ie: Coursera course development, micro-courses in LevelUp, etc.)


## Goals, Objectives, & Key Results

**Annual Goal:** _Monetize TeamOps model; generate enough revenue to breakeven on department expenses_ 
- Q1 = Build Funnel (Content/Services Validation and Pricing)
- Q2 = Fill Funnel (Sales and Marketing)
- Q3 = Automate Funnel (Page Functionality) 
- Q4 = Measure TeamOps (Integrate into GitLab)

**Ongoing Workplace Operations**
- Standardize, optimize, evangelize and monetize GitLab’s ways of working (TeamOps) to equalize employee experience
- Produce and publish TeamOps social media content on a weekly basis 
- Host 1 TeamOps Group Conversation / AMA per quarter
- Strategize and approve decisions related to virtual workplace experience as Workplace DRI
- Optimize virtual “environmental” employee experiences (eg: digestibility and retention of handbook content, organizational behavior observation opportunities during onboarding, “office tours”, etc.) 
- Maintain GitLab’s position as an international, iconic thought leader in Workplace innovation

**Stable Counterparts**
- People: optimize workforce culture, collaboration, productivity, retention, innovation, and engagement.
- Marketing: Public speaking and social media marketing about TeamOps 


## TeamOps Timeline

**TeamOps: Past**
- [FY23-Q3](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1841): TeamOps was launched as a simple LevelUp course by the Workplace team as an evolution of the MECC (Managing So Everyone Can Contribute)
- [FY23-Q4](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1978): With the goal of monetization and repeatability, TeamOps was converted from a `Management Theory` to an `Operational Model.` In so doing, TeamOps became replicable, cyclical, and measurable.  (This video is a recap of those updates.)

**TeamOps: Present** 
- FY24 (See previous section)

**TeamOps: Future (3 Year Plan)**
- FY25: Scale TeamOps workshop and consulting sales (see graphic below)
- FY26: Explore TeamOps software development or integration opportunities
