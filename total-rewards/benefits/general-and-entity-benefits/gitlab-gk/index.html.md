## Specific to Japan Based Team Members

Team members in Japan have the following statutory state benefits available: medical, pension, and unemployment.

GitLab does not plan on offering additional private medical or pension benefits at this time due to the government cover.

GitLab will continue to review responses from the [Global Benefits Survey](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/benefits-survey/#global-benefits-survey) as well as budgetary availability with respect to adding supplementary benefits in Japan. 

### Medical

All the Japanese team members will be covered by a statutory benefit known as Social Insurance. This health insurance plan will be managed by the National Health Insurance Association (Zenkoku-Kenkohoken-Kyokai or in short Kyokai Kenpo). 

### Pension

Team members registered to the Social Insurance are also registered with the Employee Pension system. This system provides a pension to members who have worked in Japan at least 25 years from the age of 60 years old. Pension benefits depend form individual career so there is no standard payments.

### Unemployment Insurance

* All the Japanese team members are entitled to the government’s unemployment insurance system, known as koyou hoken (unemployment insurance).

* Members enrolling in unemployment insurance must be working at least 20 hours per week, and to expect to be employed for at least 31 days.

* Members covered by the Social general insurance system “Kyokai Kenpo” are entitled to a benefit of an annual health check up in any of the hospitals designated under “Kyokai Kenpo”. The Japanese team members can also have a checkup in a non-designated institution. 
* In both the cases the team members can expense up to 12000 JPY against the actual bills via Expensify. 
    * The invoice must be uploaded to Expensify to validate the total remiburseable amount. Please do not upload any personal medican data, only the invoice with the total amount due. If you have any questions or concerns please reach out to Total Rewards.
