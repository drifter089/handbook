## Specific to Japan Based Team Members

Team members in Japan are on statutory state benefits. This includes medical, pension, and unemployment.

GitLab does not plan on offering additional private medical or pension benefits at this time due to the government cover.

GitLab will continue to review responses from the [Global Benefits Survey](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/benefits-survey/#global-benefits-survey) as well as budgetary availability with respect to adding a Life Insurance policy for team members in Japan.

### Medical

All the Japanese team members will be covered by a statutory benefit known as Social Insurance. This health insurance plan will be managed by the National Health Insurance Association (Zenkoku-Kenkohoken-Kyokai or in short Kyokai Kenpo). 

### Pension

Team members registered to the Social Insurance are also registered with the Employee Pension system. This system provides a pension to members who have worked in Japan at least 25 years from the age of 60 years old. Pension benefits depend form individual career so there is no standard payments.

National Pension plan typically offers monthly payment between 100,000 JPY and 250,000 JPY depending on salary for people who contributed at least 25 years in the system.

### Unemployment Insurance

* All the Japanese team members are entitled to the government’s unemployment insurance system, known as koyou hoken (unemployment insurance). Koyou hoken, also known as shitsugyou hokken (unemployment benefit), is meant to help members, including foreign members, who have recently been unemployed.
