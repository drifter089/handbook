## Medical

GitLab offers a private medical plan through VHI which gives you access to cutting-edge medical treatments, health screenings and protection against the high medical costs of private care. GitLab covers 100% of the premiums for team members and eligible dependents.

For a full breakdown of plan descriptions please review the following [Company Plan Plus Level 1.3 details](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pnyWAp71MMYzdsUm1rk0o4gq7k8cdvJO/view?usp=sharing) and [Table of Benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0cfnrKSTyQIyAEro3wR7i2aBLHsvXEv/view?usp=sharing).

To find out which hospitals and treatment centers are covered on your plan, please refer to the directories of approved facilities which are available at `Vhi.ie/downloads` or contact VHI directly via the Corporate Advice Line: `056 777 5800`.

**Does Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) Apply?**
From 1st of May 2015, if you are 35 or over when you first take out private health insurance, you will pay an additional amount of 2% for each year that you are aged 35 and over. Please contact VHI if you think this may apply.

### Enroll in the VHI Plan

GitLab's VHI scheme will begin November 1, 2020. You can choose to enroll from this date or from your hire date (if later than Nov 1st). Team members will need to enroll via VHI directly either through the online portal or by calling VHI. GitLab has selected Company Plan Plus Level 1.3 company wide. If you feel that this does not suit your needs (or family member needs), please call VHI on `056 777 5800` and they will be able to discuss your requirements.

As part of the initial enrollment, please use the following [enrollment guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YwsQp7ybVZ7cYg5G4EBlPFBJskxmjfqG/view?usp=sharing) to review the plans and enroll either via the online platform or by calling VHI. Enrollment will close on October 26th for a November 1st effective date.

### Tax Implications of Medical Plans

The health insurance allowance is treated like any other income or allowance under Revenue Commissioners rules. Your normal tax rate including other statutory deductions will apply. You will be liable for Benefit in kind on your health insurance premium, for more information please read [here](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/medical-insurance-premiums/index.aspx). 

## Pension

GitLab offers a private pension plan via a defined contribution scheme. Orca Financial is an Irish owned Financial Services company to help with the administration of the pension on behalf of GitLab. The pension provider is **Aviva**. Aviva allows for transfers into the plan and can set up an AVC pension for any members that wish to contribute above the minimum required contribution.

Orca has put together the following [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IkVkLVtKonn8JsJ2hNGZI_89V3FZyPIU/view?usp=sharing) with information about the plan as a resource.  

### Pension Match

GitLab will match up to 5% of annual base salary of the team member's contributions.

### Enrollment

To enroll in the pension plan or to make changes to an existing contribution, please email `total-rewards@gitlab.com` with the desired percent contribution. Total Rewards will add Orca Financial `info@orca.ie` to the email thread. Orca will gather all relevant information from the team member to add to the pension plan. On the 7th of every month, Orca will send Payroll and Total Rewards a summary of any changes to the pension plan which Total Rewards will update in the appropriate payroll changes spreadsheet. Total Rewards will also file the original election email in BambooHR under the "Benefits and ISO" folder for an audit trail.

After each pay cycle, Payroll will send Aviva (ccing Orca and Total Rewards) a spreadsheet with all contributions for Aviva to reconcile. 

If you have any questions about a pension plan, how pension benefits work in Ireland, or anything else, please reach out to Orca Financial who will be able to assist you directly. Email: `info@orca.ie` Phone: `+353 1 2103030`
