## Medical

GitLab offers a private medical plan through VHI which gives you access to cutting-edge medical treatments, health screenings and protection against the high medical costs of private care. GitLab covers 100% of the premiums for team members and eligible dependents.

For a full breakdown of plan descriptions please review the following [Company Plan Plus Level 1.3 details](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pnyWAp71MMYzdsUm1rk0o4gq7k8cdvJO/view?usp=sharing) and [Table of Benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0cfnrKSTyQIyAEro3wR7i2aBLHsvXEv/view?usp=sharing).

To find out which hospitals and treatment centers are covered on your plan, please refer to the directories of approved facilities which are available at `Vhi.ie/downloads` or contact VHI directly via the Corporate Advice Line: `056 777 5800`.

**Does Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) Apply?**
From 1st of May 2015, if you are 35 or over when you first take out private health insurance, you will pay an additional amount of 2% for each year that you are aged 35 and over. Please contact VHI if you think this may apply.

### Enroll in the VHI Plan

GitLab's VHI scheme will begin November 1, 2020. You can choose to enroll from this date or from your hire date (if later than Nov 1st). Team members will need to enroll via VHI directly either through the online portal or by calling VHI. GitLab has selected Company Plan Plus Level 1.3 company wide. If you feel that this does not suit your needs (or family member needs), please call VHI on `056 777 5800` and they will be able to discuss your requirements.

As part of the initial enrollment, please use the following [enrollment guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YwsQp7ybVZ7cYg5G4EBlPFBJskxmjfqG/view?usp=sharing) to review the plans and enroll either via the online platform or by calling VHI. Enrollment will close on October 26th for a November 1st effective date.

### Tax Implications of Medical Plans

The health insurance allowance is treated like any other income or allowance under Revenue Commissioners rules. Your normal tax rate including other statutory deductions will apply. You will be liable for Benefit in kind on your health insurance premium, for more information please read [here](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/medical-insurance-premiums/index.aspx). 

## Pension

GitLab offers a private pension plan via a defined contribution scheme. Orca Financial is an Irish owned Financial Services company to help with the administration of the pension on behalf of GitLab. The pension provider is **Aviva**. Aviva allows for transfers into the plan and can set up an AVC pension for any members that wish to contribute above the minimum required contribution.

Orca has put together the following [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IkVkLVtKonn8JsJ2hNGZI_89V3FZyPIU/view?usp=sharing) with information about the plan as a resource.  

### Pension Match

GitLab will match up to 5% of annual base salary of the team member's contributions.

### Enrollment

## GitLab Ireland LTD Leave Policy

* Paternity Leave in Ireland:
  *  The Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 provides two weeks' statutory leave and benefit for employees who are the relevant parents of children born or adopted.
  *  Paternity leave generally must be taken in one block of two weeks within the first six months following the birth or adoption placement. The term "relevant parent" is defined broadly to provide for fathers, adoptive fathers, civil partners, cohabitants and same-sex couples.
  *  Paternity benefit is payable by the state subject to an employee's PRSI contributions. Workers should apply for the payment 4 weeks before they intend to go on paternity leave.
  *  State paternity benefit is payable at a rate of 245 EUR per week for two weeks.
  *  Leave certification - All employees must have their paternity leave certified by their employer. If you're an employee, you must provide GitLab with proof of the expected date of confinement of your spouse or partner. In other words, you will be required to provide your employer with a certificate from your spouse or partner's doctor confirming when your baby is due, or confirmation of the babyâ€™s actual date of birth if you apply for leave after the birth has occurred. GitLab must then complete a form [(PB2: Employer Certificate for Paternity Benefit (pdf))](http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/PB2.pdf) to confirm that you are entitled to paternity leave.
  *  [If you have been at GitLab for six months, GitLab will supplement Paternity Pay up to the full salary amount](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave).
  * Process for applying for state paternity benefit:
    * Notify Total Rewards your baby's due date and how you would like to receive your benefit payment. It can be processed in two ways:
       *  By electronic funds transfer into the employee's nominated bank account, or,
       *  Mandated to GitLab's account where we would process through payroll along with any supplementary amount (if you are eligible).
    * Total Rewards will send you the completed PB2 form.
    * Submit your application for state paternity benefit via the [MyWelfare website](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/parents-children-family/).
