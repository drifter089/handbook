## Specific to Employees Based in Germany

Currently, GitLab does not provide additional benefits over and above the mandatory state requirements. [General GitLab benefits](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/) still apply. As part of the [guiding principles](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/#guiding-principles) this will be reviewed.

## German Social Security System

GitLab and team members contributions to pension, health insurance, care in old age insurance and unemployment insurance are mandatory, as required by the state system. The payments are calculated each month by payroll and are shown on the employee pay-slips.

Further information can also be found on the [Germany Trade & Invest Website](https://www.gtai.de/gtai-en/invest/investment-guide/employees-and-social-security/the-german-social-security-system-65600).

## Life Insurance

GitLab does not plan to offer different Life Insurance Benefits because team members can access employer insurance and government pension schemes to help with payments in the event of a death of a family member. The [GitLab Life Insurance plan](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#life-insurance) still applies.

#### Applying for Parental Leave in Germany

To initiate your parental leave, submit your time off by selecting the Parental Leave category in PTO by Roots at least 30 days before your leave starts. You can find out more information about GitLab's Parental Leave policy [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave).


**Vacation Leave**

Team members are entitled to at least 20 vacation days which run concurrently with GitLab PTO. The days will accrue from the start date. In general, team members must take their annual vacation days during the calendar year, otherwise it is forfeited. However, unused vacation days can be carried forward until the 31st of March of the next calendar year if the team member was unable to take the holiday due to operational or personal reasons. Team members must designate all vacation time taken as `Vacation` in PTO by Roots to ensure that vacation entitlement is properly tracked.

## Sick Time During COVID-19

During the COVID-19 Pandemic, per German labor law, team members are required to present a doctor's certificate if they need to take more than 3+ consecutive sick days. We encourage all team members to meet with a _virtual doctor_ for the certificate to avoid the need to leave home. The team member will send doctor's note to Total Rewards at total-rewards@gitlab.com. Total Rewards will file this in their BambooHR profile and forward to Payroll for processing.
