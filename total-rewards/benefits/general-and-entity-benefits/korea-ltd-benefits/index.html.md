## Specific to Korea Based Team Members

Team members in Korea are on statutory state benefits. This includes medical, pension, and life insurance.

GitLab does not plan on offering additional private medical and pension benefits at this time due to the government cover.

GitLab will continue to review responses from the [Global Benefits Survey](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/benefits-survey/#global-benefits-survey) as well as budgetary availability with respect to adding a Life Insurance policy for team members in Korea.

### Medical

GitLab does not plan to offer Private Health Insurance at this time because all the Korean team members will be covered by a statutory benefit known as National Health Insurance (NHI). This health insurance scheme covers all the team members and their family members.

### Pension

Team members registered to the Korea's Social Security Program are also registered with the National Pension Scheme. 

* Pensionable salary for contribution purposes is based on grades of standard monthly income. 
* To qualify for a pension, a person must be at least 62 years old (for those born from 1957 - 1960) and have made at least ten years of contributions. Reduced early pension can be obtained at the age of 56. The normal pension age will be raised to 65 years by 2033 (for those born in 1969 or later), and the reduced early pension age will increase to 60 years. 
* All employees are covered, excluding those working less than 15 hours per week.

### Life Insurance

GitLab does not plan to offer life insurance at this time as team members can access the benefits from Social insurance system.
