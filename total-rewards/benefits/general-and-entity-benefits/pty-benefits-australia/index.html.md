## GitLab PTY Australia Specific Benefits

### Medical
GitLab does not plan to offer Private Health Insurance at this time because Australians can access the public health system for free or at a lower cost through Medicare (funded by tax).

Please note, Medicare doesn't cover all costs and [other health services](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/subjects/whats-covered-medicare/health-care-and-medicare). Depending on the treatment, tests required and medications, individuals may still have to pay out of pocket. Some individuals may also have to pay a [Medicare levy and a Medicare levy surcharge](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/). These individuals can avoid the surcharge by taking out private health insurance.

### Superannuation
GitLab will make superannuation contributions directly to the team member's nominated super fund according to the Australian Government Super Guarantee rate which is currently set at 9.5% of the team member's total salary. Super is on top of the salary listed in the compensation calculator/contract.

#### Superannuation payments due dates

Super payment due dates has been a common topic in [#loc_australia](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CHHFS9DR7). However, there is no reason to worry when payments do not happen monthly as they may be done quarterly.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) states the following:

> You pay super for eligible employees calculated from the day they start with you. You must make the payments at least four times a year, by the quarterly due dates.

Payments due dates can be found on the [ATO website](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/paying-super-contributions/when-to-pay-super/).

#### Superannuation Salary Sacrifice
Team members in Australia have the option to make concessional super contributions by sacrificing some of their pre-tax pay and arrange to have it paid into their superfund instead. The combined total of GitLab and salary sacrificed contributions [must not be more than $25,000](https://moneysmart.gov.au/grow-your-super/super-contributions) per financial year.

*Salary Sacrifice FAQ*

* How do I make concessional contributions to my superannuation?
  * Email total-rewards@gitlab.com with the percentage or amount of your salary that you would like to sacrifice.
* Can I change the amount or opt out?
  * Yes, if you wish to change the amount/percentage or opt out, simply send total-rewards@gitlab.com an email.
* Is it possible to start from any month?
  * Yes, it would be processed on the next available payroll.


### Life insurance
GitLab does not plan to offer life insurance at this time as Australians can access [government payments and services](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/subjects/payments-people-living-illness-injury-or-disability) if they get ill, injured or have a disability. Most Australians who choose to have life insurance take out cover from their super fund.

### GitLab PTY Australia Annual, Sick and Carer's Leave
Team members in Australia are eligible to take paid time off according to our [PTO policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/). Since GitLab has a legal duty to pay out any accumulated Annual Leave when a team member leaves the company, the payroll team will deduct vacation time off requests from the team member's Annual Leave balance. This balance won't have a cap to align with GitLab's unlimited PTO policy.

Selecting the `Out Sick` option in PTO by Roots will prompt the payroll team to process any time off taken as Sick and Carer's Leave. If you wish to take Carer's Leave but don't want to change your Slack status to `Out Sick`, send your Carer's Leave request to total-rewards@gitlab.com and the Total Rewards team will manually add your leave to BambooHR and notify payroll.


### GitLab PTY Australia Parental Leave Administrative Details

**Statutory General Entitlement:**
* Employees are able to take parental leave if they:
  * have worked for their employer for at least 12 months before the date or expected date of birth if the employee is pregnant; and
  * have or will have responsibility for the care of a child.

**Australian Government Paid Parental Leave Scheme:**
* Eligible employees who are the primary carer of a newborn or adopted child get up to 18 weeks' leave paid at the [national minimum wage](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/parental-leave-pay). If the employee has been at GitLab for one year, the Parental Leave paid through GitLab will be the regular salary minus the payments made from the national minimum wage. The employee will apply online by [claiming](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/parental-leave-pay/claiming) the benefit. If you are not eligible for the government benefit, but you are eligible for 100% of parental leave pay, please reach out to People Ops for review.

**Record-keeping for paid parental leave:**
* In addition to the usual record-keeping requirements, employers that have employees getting government-funded Parental Leave Pay also have to keep the following records:
  * the amount of Parental Leave Pay funding received from the government for each employee and the period it covers
  * the date each parental leave payment was made to the employee
  * the period each payment covers
  * the gross amount of the payment
  * the net amount paid and the amount of income tax withheld (including other payments, if any, were made)
  * a statement identifying the payment as Parental Leave Pay under the Australian Government Paid Parental Leave Scheme
  * the amount of any deductions made from each payment.

**Pay slips for parental leave payments:**
* Employees who get Parental Leave Pay have to be given a pay slip for each payment. The pay slip must specify that the payments are Parental Leave Pay under the Australian Government Paid Parental Leave Scheme.
* Ordinary pay slip requirements apply to pay slips given to employees getting government-funded Parental Leave Pay. They must also include:
  * the gross and net amounts of Parental Leave Pay and the amount of income tax deducted
  * if there are other payments on the pay slip, this information must be included as well as the total gross, net and income tax amounts
  * the amount of any deduction and the name and bank details of the entity the deduction was given to.
    * Only certain deductions can be made from Parental Leave Pay under the Australian Government Paid Parental Leave Scheme.

### Applying for Parental Leave in Australia

**Notice requirements:**
* Employees who want to take unpaid parental leave need to give their employer notice that they are taking leave and confirm the dates.
* If an employee can’t give the appropriate notice (eg. the baby is born prematurely) they will still be entitled to take the leave as long as they provide notice when they can.

**10 weeks before starting leave:**
* An employee has to give notice to their employer at least 10 weeks before starting their unpaid parental leave. This notice needs to be in writing, and say how much leave they want to take, including the starting and finishing dates. If an employee can’t give 10 weeks’ notice, they need to provide as much notice as possible.

**4 weeks before starting leave:**
* An employee has to confirm their parental leave dates with their employer at least 4 weeks before they are due to start their leave. If there have been any changes to the dates the employee should tell their employer as soon as possible. If an employee can’t provide 4 weeks’ notice, they need to provide as much notice as possible.


##  GitLab PTY New Zealand Specific Benefits

### Accounting Fee Reimbursement
New Zealand team members are eligible for a one time reimbursement of up to $750 NZD for accounting or tax-related fees. The purpose of this reimbursement is to help our team members reconcile any accounting activities and tax returns from when they were independent contractors through GitLab BV or contracted through CXC. Since tax-related activities will be less complex after the transition to our team members' employment under the PTY LTD entity, this reimbursement benefit will only be valid until December 2021. To get reimbursed for this expense, please follow the [Expense Reimbursement process](/handbook/spending-company-money/#expense-policy).

### Sick Leave

Team members in New Zealand are eligible to take paid time off according to our [PTO policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/). Team members in New Zealand are entitled to 5 days' sick leave after six months’ current continuous employment with GitLab. For each 12-month period after meeting the above criteria, each team member gets at least five days’ sick leave. If in any year the team member doesn’t meet the criteria, then they don’t get any new sick leave entitlement, but can use their sick leave balance which may have carried over. An employee may re-qualify for sick leave as soon as they meet the criteria.  The maximum amount of sick leave that can be accumulated under the Holidays Act 2003 is 20 days.

* Sick Leave runs concurrently with GitLab PTO. Team members must designate any time off for illness as `Out Sick` in PTO by Roots to ensure that sick leave entitlement is properly tracked.

* In accordance with the Holidays Act, GitLab may require a medical certificate if you have been absent due to illness. 

* Unused sick leave will not be paid out to the team member upon termination of employment.

**Injured Leave**
* When the team member is taking leave for the first week of a non-work accident, they can use sick leave and/or annual leave if they have any. This leave runs concurrently with GitLab PTO. Team members must designate time off for injury as `Out Sick` or `Vacation` in PTO by Roots if they wish to use sick leave or annual leave for the first week of an injury. Team members must notify Total rewards (total-rewards@gitlab.com) as soon as possible when they will need to go out on injured leave.

* If the leave will last longer than five days and is [covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) scheme](https://www.acc.co.nz/im-injured/what-we-cover/), GitLab will top up the ACC payment from 80 to 100% for the first 25 days.

### Medical
GitLab does not plan at this time to offer Private Health Insurance benefits because New Zealand residents can access free or subsidised medical care in New Zealand through the public healthcare system. Injuries and accidents are covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation cover.

### Pension
GitLab's KiwiSaver contributions will be 3% on top of base salary. Team members will automatically be enrolled in the KiwiSaver scheme but may elect to opt out within the first 56 days of employment. GitLab will deduct a participating team member's contributions from their before-tax pay at the team member's chosen contribution rate (3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%). If a team member does not choose a contribution rate, the default rate of 3% will be used to calculate deductions.

### Life Insurance
GitLab does not plan at this time to offer Life Insurance benefits because New Zealanders can access [government payments and services](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/providers/health-and-disability-practitioners/health-and-disability-related-benefits.html) to help if they get ill, injured or have a disability.
