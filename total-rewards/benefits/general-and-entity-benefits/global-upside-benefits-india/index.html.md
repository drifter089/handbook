### Gratuity

Gratuity is a statutory offering in India per The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 which is offered through Global Upside based on the Global Upside hire date. 

### Loyalty Bonus Scheme

GitLab has implemented a private loyalty bonus scheme since some team members have been contracted through different employment types as we have worked through country conversion processes. Therefore, the GitLab Loyalty Bonus Scheme will supplement gratuity based on the GitLab hire date vs the PEO hire date. 

**Elibility:** One can only claim Loyalty Bonus after retirement or resign from the service after completing 5 years of continuous service.

**Forfeiture of Loyalty Bonus:** The full amount of Loyalty Bonus can be forfeited if a team member’s services have been terminated due to: a) Riotous or disorderly conduct or any other violent act; b) Committing an offence involving moral turpitude.

**Calculation of Loyalty Bonus:**

Loyalty Bonus Amount =  Gratuity Calculation using GitLab Hire Date + Gratuity Calculation using PEO Hire Date

`The duration for Gratuity Calculation using GitLab Hire Date is the duration prior to the hire date of the PEO`

**Note:** The Loyalty Bonus Amount is provided by GitLab to the team members. Any amount which GitLab will pay as Loyalty Bonus would be fully taxable for the team members. 

**Total Rewards Responsibilities:**
  * Maintain Gratuity Calculation sheet
  * Update the sheet every month
  * Send an email to Accounts team on or before 5th of every month to calculate the accruals.
