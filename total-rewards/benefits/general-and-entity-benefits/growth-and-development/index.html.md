## Introduction

At GitLab, team members have access to the [Growth and Development benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-benefit) to access external resources to develop their career. 

### Growth and Development Benefit Eligibility 

Team members who are full-time and have been employed for three months can participate in this benefit. If you are a part-time GitLab team member, you may still be eligible to participate in this benefit but your reimbursement might be reduced. These situations will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

Examples of requests that may be approved:
* A Backend Engineer who is not on a performance improvement plan seeking a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
* A People Operations Generalist seeking a master's in Human Resources with a concentration in International Employee Relations.
* A Security Analyst seeking to take courses to gain a Cybersecurity certificate through an accredited college or university.
* A Product Marketing Manager seeking to take courses to become a Certified Brand Manager from The Association of International Product Marketing and Management.
* A Technical Account Manager seeking to obtain a Cloud Certification such as CompTIA Cloud, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, MicroSoft MCSA/MCSE, Cisco CCNA/CCNP.
* Learning how to code for all team members (for example [Learning Rails on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-rails)).

Examples of requests that may be denied:
* A Marketing Manager seeking a master's in Human Resources, but has no intention of applying to a role in people ops.
* A Frontend Engineer seeking a master's in computer science who is on a performance improvement plan or having discussions around underperformance.
* If the tuition reimbursement budget has been reached, then your request may be denied, even if you meet eligibility requirements.

This [list](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#example-programs-by-department) covers some department-specific example programs that team members have recommended.

### How to Apply For Growth and Development Benefits

#### For Growth & Development Benefits that cost under $1,000 USD

We encourage you to seek verbal approval from your manager before you sign up to anything. If the cost is under $1,000 USD, please fill out the [Growth & Development Benefit Form (Under $1,000)](https://forms.gle/ZLH2KtEqxBtW1Bja6) and submit your expenses via [Expensify](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#expense-reimbursement). 

#### For Growth & Development Benefits that cost over $1,000 USD**

Once your manager has verbally approved your plan, please fill out the [Growth & Development Benefit Form (Over $1,000 USD)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoql6Yr-r8j_XjUjJNnJRzgf2rOsOE-gXpydn6r1INLqEfKw/viewform) at least 30 days before the commencement date. Total Rewards will stage a Growth & Development Agreement for you and obtain signatures from the approvers per the table below. If the education provider does not allow for tuition/payment deferment and this would cause financial strain, you can request to receive 50% of the reimbursement up front and the other 50% upon successful completion of the course/program (this option is available for reimbursements above $1,000 USD only as it is processed via payroll).

Reimbursements above $1,000 USD will be paid via payroll in the following pay cycle after you have completed the program and meet any extra eligibility requirements stated in the table below. For Your 4th Trimester Coaching, GitLab will pay the provider directly.

If you voluntarily terminate employment with GitLab prior to completing twelve consecutive months of active employment, expenses of $1,000 USD and over will need to be refunded to GitLab. If you opted to receive 50% of the reimbursement up front but the total amount on your form is at least $1,000 USD, the amount will still need to be refunded back to GitLab.

#### Tax Implications for Tuition Reimbursement by Country

In some countries, the Growth and Development Benefit may be considered as taxable income and can be (partially) exempted from personal income taxes or subject to employer withholding taxes.

For example, in the United States 2021 tax year, if GitLab pays over [$5,250 for educational benefits for you during the year, you must generally pay tax on the amount over $5,250](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-benefits-for-education-information-center).

Please contact [Payroll](mailto:payroll@gitlab.com) or [People Ops](peopleops@gitlab.com) for any tax-related questions in your country.

GitLab will provide Your 4th Trimester with a report monthly of any team members with an upcoming parental leave: expected leave date, expected return to work date, date of birthing event, country, whether the person has already opted in, and maternity or paternity leave.

**Billing:**
Your 4th Trimester will bill GitLab for this benefit quarterly with 50% at intake and 50% at the completion of the coaching program per participant. If there are more than 5 participants in a quarter, there will be a discount on the bill. If there are any tax implications for the GitLab team member, Total Rewards will work with payroll to ensure this is reported compliantly.
