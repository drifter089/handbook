## Introduction

## Growth and Development Benefit Eligibility 

* Team members who are full-time and have been employed for three months can participate in this benefit. If you are a part-time GitLab team member, you may still be eligible to participate in this benefit but your reimbursement might be reduced. These situations will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.
* Team members who are meeting performance expectations in their current role:
    * Currently in good standing with GitLab in terms of performance and behaviours
    * Not currently on a [PIP](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/#performance-improvement-plan-pip)
    * Not on any type of remedial, formal coaching as outlined in the [Underperformance page](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/)

**Examples of requests that may be approved:**
* A Backend Engineer who is not on a performance improvement plan seeking a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
* A People Operations Generalist seeking a master's in Human Resources with a concentration in International Employee Relations.
* A Security Analyst seeking to take courses to gain a Cybersecurity certificate through an accredited college or university.
* A Product Marketing Manager seeking to take courses to become a Certified Brand Manager from The Association of International Product Marketing and Management.
* A Technical Account Manager seeking to obtain a Cloud Certification such as CompTIA Cloud, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, MicroSoft MCSA/MCSE, Cisco CCNA/CCNP.

**Examples of requests that may be denied:**
* A Marketing Manager seeking a master's in Human Resources, but has no intention of applying to a role in people ops.
* A Frontend Engineer seeking a master's in computer science who is on a performance improvement plan or having discussions around underperformance.
* If the tuition reimbursement budget has been reached, then your request may be denied, even if you meet eligibility requirements.


## How to Apply For Growth and Development Benefits

1. Applying team members must have a [career development conversation](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#what-is-career-development) with their manager to discuss the learning opportunity. It's important to discuss timing, team member capacity, and application timeline for both the program and benefit processing. This conversation should allow time for both the team member to apply for program/benefit and the manager to ensure team budget capacity.

2. Create a new Growth & Development issue at least 30 days before the commencement date:
    * Use [this issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/total-rewards/-/issues/new?issuable_template=academic_study) for applications relating to Academic Study
    * Use [this issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/total-rewards/-/issues/new?issuable_template=other-growth-development) for other types of Growth & Development applications

* Note: This application process is visible internally. It is preferred and more efficient to create an issue for your application, however, if there is any reason that you would like to keep your application confidential, please send growth-development@gitlab an email with the details of your application (refer to the issue templates for the information required).

3. Request approval on the issue. Manager approval is needed for all applications and Executive Leader approval is needed for applications above $1000 USD. 

* Once the manager has approved, there is no further action to be taken by the manager. They can unassign themselves to the issue if they wish. Total Rewards will update the labels on the issue.

* **Field organization executive signatures should be routed by the following:**
  - Enterprise Sales: Mike Pyle (VP of Enterprise Sales)
  - Customer Success: David Sakamoto (VP of Customer Success)
  - Commercial Sales: Ryan O'Nell (VP of Commercial Sales)
  - Field Operations: David Hong (VP of Field Operations)
  - Worldwide Channels: Michelle Hodges (VP of Worldwide Channels) 

4. Claim for reimbursement: 
* If you have signed up for academic study, you may claim for [reimbursement](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#reimbursements-of-growth-and-development-applications) once you receive your grade/transcript (this can be done at the end of each semester if your course is split into semesters or at the end of the program). You may close the issue once you have received reimbursement for the whole program. 
* For other types of Growth & Development opportunities, you may claim for [reimbursement](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#reimbursements-of-growth-and-development-applications) once you have obtained the reimbursement requirement per the [table below](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#types-of-growth-and-development-reimbursements). You may close the issue once you have gained approval for your application.

## Tax Implications

Check [the tax table](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/tax/) for any tax implications in your country.

For example, in the United States 2021 tax year, if GitLab pays over [$5,250 for educational benefits for you during the year, you must generally pay tax on the amount over $5,250](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-benefits-for-education-information-center).

### Administration of Your 4th Trimester 

1. If the team member lives in a country where this benefit is considered taxable income (currently only in Australia and some cases in Belgium), notify payroll.
1. Total Rewards will send an introductory email to Your 4th Trimester to the team member and Barbara Palmer `barbara@your4thtrimester.com` outlining the expected leave date, expected return to work date and date of birthing event. Barbara will conduct the intake with the team member and communicate directly for any coaching throughout the program. 

**Monthly Reporting:**
GitLab will provide Your 4th Trimester with a report monthly of any team members with an upcoming parental leave: expected leave date, expected return to work date, date of birthing event, country, whether the person has already opted in, and maternity or paternity leave. The purpose of this monthly report is to ensure Your 4th Trimester can plan accordingly to the volume of coaching for GitLab team members. 

**Billing:**
Your 4th Trimester will bill GitLab for this benefit quarterly with 50% at intake and 50% at the completion of the coaching program per participant. If there are more than 5 participants in a quarter, there will be a discount on the bill. If there are any tax implications for the GitLab team member, Total Rewards will work with payroll to ensure this is reported compliantly.
