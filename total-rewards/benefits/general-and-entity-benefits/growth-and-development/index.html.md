## Introduction

At GitLab, team members have access to the [Growth and Development benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-benefit) to access external resources to develop their career. 

### Growth and Development Benefit Eligibility 

Team members who are full-time and have been employed for three months can participate in this benefit. If you are a part-time GitLab team member, you may still be eligible to participate in this benefit but your reimbursement might be reduced. These situations will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

Examples of requests that may be approved:
* A Backend Engineer who is not on a performance improvement plan seeking a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
* A People Operations Generalist seeking a master's in Human Resources with a concentration in International Employee Relations.
* A Security Analyst seeking to take courses to gain a Cybersecurity certificate through an accredited college or university.
* A Product Marketing Manager seeking to take courses to become a Certified Brand Manager from The Association of International Product Marketing and Management.
* A Technical Account Manager seeking to obtain a Cloud Certification such as CompTIA Cloud, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, MicroSoft MCSA/MCSE, Cisco CCNA/CCNP.
* Learning how to code for all team members (for example [Learning Rails on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-rails)).

Examples of requests that may be denied:
* A Marketing Manager seeking a master's in Human Resources, but has no intention of applying to a role in people ops.
* A Frontend Engineer seeking a master's in computer science who is on a performance improvement plan or having discussions around underperformance.
* If the tuition reimbursement budget has been reached, then your request may be denied, even if you meet eligibility requirements.

**Please note that in order to be eligiblity for the Growth and Development benefit, a team member must be meeting performance expectations in their current role.**

### How to Apply For Growth and Development Benefits

**For Growth & Development Benefits that cost under $1,000 USD**
We encourage you to seek verbal approval from your manager before you sign up to anything. If the cost is $1,000 USD or less, please fill out the [Growth & Development Benefit Form (Under $1,000)](https://forms.gle/ZLH2KtEqxBtW1Bja6) and submit your expenses via [Expensify](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#expense-reimbursement). 

**For Growth & Development Benefits that cost over $1,000 USD**
Once your manager has verbally approved your plan, please fill out the [Growth & Development Benefit Form (Over $1,000 USD)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoql6Yr-r8j_XjUjJNnJRzgf2rOsOE-gXpydn6r1INLqEfKw/viewform) at least 30 days before the commencement date. Total Rewards or Learning & Development will stage a Growth & Development Agreement for you and obtain signatures from the approvers per the table below. If the education provider does not allow for tuition/payment deferment and this would cause financial strain, you can request to receive 50% of the reimbursement up front and the other 50% upon successful completion of the course/program (this option is available for reimbursements above $1,000 USD only as it is processed via payroll).

#### Reimbursement 
Reimbursements above $1,000 USD will be paid via payroll in the following pay cycle after you have completed the program and meet any extra eligibility requirements stated in the table below. For Your 4th Trimester Coaching, GitLab will pay the provider directly.

Reimbursements for over $1,000 USD will be processed by the following: 
1. Team member fills out Growth & Development Benefit Form for over $1,000 USD
1. All parties will sign the document following the [approval flow below](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#approval-flow-for-benefits-over-1000)
1. L&D or Total Rewards will notify the team member that all parties have signed the document and the file will be uploaded into their BambooHR folder
1. Once the team member completes the program, please send proof of completion to `total-rewards@gitlab.com` and `learning@gitlab.com`
1. For reimbursements for conferences, workshops, professional membership, please also send the invoice to `total-rewards@gitlab.com` and `learning@gitlab.com` once you have signed up
1. Once proof of completion and/or invoices are received, L&D or Total Rewards will notify payroll to begin the reimbursement process. Please see the below [table](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#types-of-growth-and-development-reimbursements) for what additional documentation may be required for reimbursement.
1. **At this time team members will not submit expenses through Expensify for Growth & Development funds over $1000 USD**
1. Once payroll is notified, reimbursement will occur in the following pay cycle for the team member

If you voluntarily terminate employment with GitLab prior to completing twelve consecutive months of active employment, expenses of $1,000 USD and over will need to be refunded to GitLab. If you opted to receive 50% of the reimbursement up front but the total amount on your form is at least $1,000 USD, the amount will still need to be refunded back to GitLab.

#### Approval Flow for Benefits over $1,000

If requesting over $1,000 for the Growth & Development benefit, the approval flow will follow the following sequence: 
1. Form uploaded into DocuSign and sent

### How to Apply for an Exception

GitLab understands that tuition costs for academic study can cost more than the $10,000 USD yearly limit. If you have a strong business justification to take up a course or degree and the tuition costs will exceed this limit, then you can apply for an exception (for a maximum amount of up to $20,000 USD per calendar year). To apply, send Total Rewards and Learning & Development an e-mail (keep your manager copied) with the course information, business justification for the exception and the yearly cost. Please send the e-mail at least 30 days before your course commencement date.

Total Rewards will get an approval from GitLab's Compensation Group then notify you and the L&D team the outcome. If approved, you can fill out a [Growth & Development Benefit Form (Over $1,000 USD)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoql6Yr-r8j_XjUjJNnJRzgf2rOsOE-gXpydn6r1INLqEfKw/viewform) for the upcoming semester. A new form submission will be needed for each following semester.

### Tax Implications for Tuition Reimbursement by Country

In some countries, the Growth and Development Benefit may be considered as taxable income and can be (partially) exempted from personal income taxes or subject to employer withholding taxes.

For example, in the United States 2021 tax year, if GitLab pays over [$5,250 for educational benefits for you during the year, you must generally pay tax on the amount over $5,250](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-benefits-for-education-information-center).

Please contact [Payroll](mailto:payroll@gitlab.com) or [People Ops](mailto:peopleops@gitlab.com) for any tax-related questions in your country.

1. Check the team member's eligibility and check that the team member's year-to-date spend is within the $10,000 USD limit (check the `Tally` tab on the log). Some team members may have granted an exception to spend up to $20,000 USD for academic study. Any exceptions will be marked `Yes` on the `Limit Exception` column.
1. Download the team member's Growth and Development Benefit Agreement from the "Populated Agreements" folder and stage the document in DocuSign.
1. Fill out the Status columns (in blue) on the Growth and Development Benefit Log sheet.
   * For 4th Trimester expenses, tag Total Rewards on the sheet.

Once all parties have signed the agreement, send an e-mail to the team member to notify them that the agreement has been signed and to send their transcript, certificate of completion or invoice (refer to the [reimbursement category table](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#types-of-growth-and-development-reimbursements)) once they are ready to receive the reimbursement.
1. Save the signed agreement in the team member's BambooHR "Benefits and ISO" folder.

Total Rewards will send an introductory email to Your 4th Trimester to the team member and Barbara Palmer `barbara@your4thtrimester.com` outlining the expected leave date, expected return to work date and date of birthing event. Barbara will conduct the intake with the team member and communicate directly for any coaching throughout the program. 

**Monthly Reporting:**
GitLab will provide Your 4th Trimester with a report monthly of any team members with an upcoming parental leave: expected leave date, expected return to work date, date of birthing event, country, whether the person has already opted in, and maternity or paternity leave. The purpose of this monthly report is to ensure Your 4th Trimester can plan accordingly to the volume of coaching for GitLab team members. 

**Billing:**
Your 4th Trimester will bill GitLab for this benefit quarterly with 50% at intake and 50% at the completion of the coaching program per participant. If there are more than 5 participants in a quarter, there will be a discount on the bill.
