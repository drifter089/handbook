 GitLab currently has no plans to offer Life Insurance, Private Medical cover, or a private pension due to the government cover in Spain. If GitLab did want to look into offering such benefits through Safeguard, the employees would need to subscribe themselves to the insurance companies and they would be paid for it in the form of allowance on a monthly basis covering the price that the insurance company requests; this would then be billed to Gitlab.


## Other countries

Safeguard uses multiple third parties across the globe to assist in locations where they do not have a direct payroll.
