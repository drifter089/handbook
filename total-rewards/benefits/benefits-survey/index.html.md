## Global Benefits Survey

We've partnered with Culture Amp to run our Global Benefits Survey, which will launch annually in June.  We run this survey to collect feedback from all team members, which will be aggregated and analyzed. Using Culture Amp's reporting tools, we'll analyze the data to find the most common trends for desired benefit iterations. We will use this information to generate a roadmap and share these results with everyone at GitLab.

This is an opportunity to share with the Total Rewards team what benefits you think are great, what benefits are lacking, and what you think is most important to adjust. While we will review and prioritize all feedback, not all input may be implemented in the next few iterations. We will continue to ask the organization what is important to team members, but also take into account our fiduciary responsibility to maintain our operating costs.

**Timeline of the Survey Results:**
* Survey goes out to team members
* Survey closes
* Survey results analyzed
* Survey Results Shared with the GitLab Team
* Survey Results issues opened to begin implementation of any changes
* Q3 OKR to implement changes based on survey results viewed in Q2

Thank you again for playing a part in our efforts to continually improve total rewards at GitLab. If you have any questions, please reach out to the Total Rewards team via email.

## Benefits Not Currently Being Implemented

This section serves to highlight benefits that we have previously researched, but have decided not to move forward with implementing at this time. As the company grows, circumstances change, and/or we receive new information, we may decide to revisit any benefits added to this list.

### Telehealth

We researched and selected four vendors to receive more information. Demo calls were conducted with three of these vendors where we learned more about the solutions and pricing. After reviewing the [results of the benefits survey](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/benefits-survey/#global-benefits-survey-results), there wasnâ€™t enough interest in a telehealth solution to justify the price so we decided to not move forward with any of the vendors at this time.

While we aren't offering a global telehealth solution at this time, team members based in the US who are enrolled in our [UHC](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/#uhc-telehealth) or [Kaiser](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/#kaiser-telehealth) medical plans can access telehealth services through these plans. Other team members may have options for telehealth available to them through their provider.

Further information and corresponding discussion are available under [Compensation Issue #15](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/Compensation/issues/15) (internal).

### Coworking Space Agreement

We researched whether there was an account that could be set up with a coworking space chain that would make it easier for team members to utilize these spaces. Three major chains with global coverage were contacted with one responding. After conducting a survey, the type of account this chain offers doesn't align with the way the majority of team members utilize coworking spaces. Team members are still welcome to follow the existing process of [expensing a coworking space](/handbook/spending-company-money/).

Further information, survey results, and corresponding discussion are available under [Compensation Issue #30](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/Compensation/issues/30) (internal).

### Wellness Program

We researched and selected three vendors and conducted a cost analysis with Finance. At this time, it does not fit into the budget for benefits to be offered for FY21, but will be revisited when we evaluate benefits and budget for the next fiscal year. Further information and corresponding discussion are available under [Compensation Issue #37](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/Compensation/-/issues/37) (internal).
