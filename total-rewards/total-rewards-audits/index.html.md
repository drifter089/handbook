## BambooHR Audits

### Onboarding Audit

Cadence: Each new joiner.

### Payroll Changes Report Audit

Cadence: Weekly

BambooHR creates a standard Payroll Change report to capture any changes processed on a team member's profile. At the end of each week, a member of the Total Rewards team reviews each change captured in the report to ensure the change was intentional, inputted correctly, and proper processing was followed for the change. Once the change has been reviewed, it can be checked off on the Payroll Change report. 

### New Hire Audit

This audit is meant to identify and fix any errors that may have missed during the initial [onboarding audit](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/total-rewards-audits/#onboarding-audit).

Process: 

1. In BambooHR, access the custom report "New Hire Audit." 
1. Edit the report and adjust the Hire Date filters to include all new hires since the audit was last ran up to the most recent Friday.

     * Locality: Returns FALSE if the team member's Country doesn't match the country in their Locality. 
     * Region: Returns FALSE if the team member's Region doesn't match the correct region for the Country listed.
     * I-9: Returns FALSE if the team member is located in the US AND the I-9 box is not checked OR the team member is not located in the US AND the I-9 box is checked. The I-9 box should never be checked for someone not located in the US. If the person is located in the US and the box hasn't been checked, check their onboarding issue to see if this has been verified by the People Experience team.

     * Division: Checks whether the team member's Division is aligned to their Department. 
     * Department: Returns FALSE if the team member's Department does not match the Department of their manager. Exceptions to this can be added to the "Exceptions" tab in column B. An example of this would be a VP who leads a more specialized department than the executive they report to. 
     * Payroll Type: This checks to make sure the team member is categorized into the correct Payroll Type based on their Country. For example, someone in Australia should be "Employee" while someone in India should be "Employee-PEO".

     * Pay Schedule: Returns TRUE if team members in the US have a Pay Schedule of "Twice a month", team members in Canada have a Pay Schedule of "Every other week", and team members in all other countries have a Pay Schedule of "Monthly".

     * Conversion Effective Date: Returns TRUE if the correct Effective Date for the currency conversion is being used depending on when the last currency conversion refresh took place, either January 1 or July 1. 
     * Currency Conversion Factor: Returns TRUE if the correct [Exchange Rate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates) is being used. This will also check that the correct Currency is in BambooHR.  
     * Conversion: Returns TRUE if the Currency Conversion Factor multiplied by the Local Annual Salary equals the USD Annual Salary.

     * Job Code: Returns TRUE if the Job Code entered in BambooHR is equivalent to the Job Code that matches the team member's Job Title per the Job Codes Sheet.
     * Job Grade: Returns TRUE if the Grade corresponding to the Job Code per the Job Codes Sheet is entered in BambooHR.
