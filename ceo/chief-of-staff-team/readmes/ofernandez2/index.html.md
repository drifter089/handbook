<!-- This template will help you build out your very own GitLab README, a great tool for transparently letting others know what it's like to work with you, and how you prefer to be communicated with.

## Omar Fernandez's README

**Omar Fernandez, Director of Strategy and Operations**

This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship.

Please feel free to contribute to this page by opening a merge request or, if a GitLab team member, [submitting an anonymous suggestion](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLDiGotjcQsbM-jH9vVTH1lVWKjZgwj3raZ8gcUiFN3LwuaQ/viewform).

## About me

* I was born and raised in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, and first moved out of Puerto Rico to attend college in Cambridge, MA.
* I love visiting my family, most of which lives in the Southwest coast of Puerto Rico.
* I track my book reading in [my Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/132507049-omar-fern-ndez).
* My husband and I have been living in Brooklyn, NY since late 2019. Given the COVID pandemic, my NYC experience has been full of unique charm.
* I've visited 27 countries if I counted correctly in this [Visited Countries Map](https://www.amcharts.com/visited_countries/#AT,CZ,FR,HU,IS,IT,NL,ES,SE,GB,CA,DO,MX,PR,US,CO,PE,MA,CN,HK,IN,JP,PH,KR,TW,TH,VN)

## How you can help me

* I highly value feedback in any form. Please don't shy away from giving me feedback at any time.
* If you work at GitLab, and prefer to give feedback anonymously, you can use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLDiGotjcQsbM-jH9vVTH1lVWKjZgwj3raZ8gcUiFN3LwuaQ/viewform). Getting feedback continuously rather than waiting for formal reviews helps me improve my working ways and habits in smaller steps, bringing a level of iteration to personal improvement which is more manageable.

## My working style

* At work, achieving results both individually and as a team is most important to me. If I'm not achieving results, all my energy will be focused on how to fix this. (Related: Enneagram result of Self-Preservation Type 3, StrengthsFinder strengths of Achiever and Activator)
* I'm adaptable and don't mind switching between leading and contributing to initiatives as long as I understand why the work is important and believe that we are on the right track. (related: Alignment is a top strength per BetterUp results.)
* I enjoy building good relationships, both in my personal life and at work.
* I value writing as a way to force clear communication. When something is unclear, I will write it down, edit for clarity, and share the write-up as a starting point for discussions.
* Planning ahead is key to a smooth and productive day.
* Please try to send meeting invites 2+ days ahead of when you'd like to meet and make it clear why I'm needed. It helps me better plan my work.
* I will try to get back to you within 1 working day for any emails, Slack pings, comment tags, etc. If I haven't responded to you within 1-2 working days, please ping again.
* I value my time off work to recharge and aim to not check any work messages outside of my working hours. (Related: Rest as a top strength per BetterUp)

## What I assume about others

* I'll assume honesty and good intention in our interactions. I may be too trusting (see "Agreeableness" in my "Big Five" results), but I've been lucky enough to be surrounded by great people. Defaulting to trusting people has made it easier for me to build great relationships more quickly.
* I'll assume that you'll follow through on any agreements we've made, or that you'll communicate a change in priorities. (Related: I score high on "Empowerment" per BetterUp.)

## What I want to earn

* My goal at GitLab is to contribute to the best of my abilities and, as I do so, to learn and get better each day.
* It's not all work, I highly value connection and developing good relationships with my coworkers. There's nothing better than being able to genuinely laugh with colleagues as we navigate both the ups and downs at work and in life.

## Strengths/Weaknesses

* I like to drive results, which is generally a strength, but at times it makes me focus on the first path to a solution and not explore enough alternatives. If you notice that I'm jumping to a solution before exploring alternatives, please tell me.
* My energy level and mood get impacted very noticeably by hunger or a lack of sleep. If we have a meeting and I wasn't able to sleep well or grab a meal, I will aim to let you know so you're not surprised by unusually low energy.

## Personality tests (by recency)

### 2021 MBTI Executive Type ([ESTJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/estj-personality))

Whether subordinates, among colleagues or as managers, people with the Executive personality type create order, follow the rules, and work to ensure that their work and the work of those around them is completed to the highest standards. Cutting corners and shirking responsibility are the quickest ways to lose Executives’ respect.

### 2020 Enneagram Result: Self-Preservation Type 3 (Achiever)

Self-Preservation Threes work hard to assure material security for themselves and the people around them. Oriented to being good (as well as looking good) according to social consensus, they want to appear successful, but they don’t want to brag or self-promote in an obvious way (because that wouldn’t be good). SP Threes are self-sufficient, extremely hard-working, results-oriented, and modest. ([Source](https://www.beatricechestnut.com/2017/08/instinctual-subtype-dimension-enneagram))

### 2018 StrenghtsFinder signature themes ([Detailed Results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UE5IiGfrTxXDKR8NwowD7ICcn_r5xxf_))
