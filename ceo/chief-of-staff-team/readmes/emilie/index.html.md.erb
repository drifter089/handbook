# Emilie Schario
{:.no_toc}

**Internal Strategy Consultant, Data**

This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. 

It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, 
and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team.

Please feel free to contribute to this page by opening a merge request. 

## Guiding principles
* [I will create opportunity for myself and others](https://ventureforamerica.org/become-a-fellow/is-vfa-for-me/). 
* Life is easier when we play like we're on the same team. 
* If you walk by a straw wrapper on the floor, pick it up. 

You don't have to solve all the problems of the universe. 
Just the one sitting right in front of you.

## My time at GitLab

I joined GitLab in June 2018.
I was hired as GitLab's first Data Analyst into the Data Team by my then-manager [Taylor Murphy](/company/team/#tayloramurphy). 
When I joined GitLab I wanted three things in a role: 1. to be a first-class team member in an all-remote organization, 2. to be part of a team, and 3. the opportunity to grow with GitLab. 
I had experienced hybrid-remote teams and knew how difficult it was to be the exception-to-the-in-office-rule.
I've spent a lot of time as the solo-data person, and my knowledge was a bit cobbled together. 
I wanted to be part of team to have people to learn from and develop ideas with. 
And, I wasn't looking for role for the next year to eighteen months. 
I was looking for where I was going to be for a long-term growth opportunity.
And, wow, has GitLab checked all my boxes!

I spent 10 months as a Data Analyst (what some other people would call an [Analytics Engineer](https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/)) with over six months as the *sole* data analyst, as the company grew from under 300 to over 600.
In May 2019, I moved into a Data Engineering role, ready for my next challenge as the team and my technical chops grew.

In September 2019, I moved into the Chief of Staff Team as an Internal Strategy Consultant, Data. 
If you had asked me in June if I would ever have moved into a Strategy role, or really anywhere outside of the data team, I probably would have laughed. 
I mean, I spent my own money buying `gitlabdata.com`. 
I have had big visions for the GitLab Data Team since before I accepted my offer that spring day in 2018. 
But right now, it's an incredible challenge, and I'm really enjoying what I do. 
And, there's still no better feeling than having a question and being able to answer it myself! 

## Working with me

### Default to asynchronous  
{:.no_toc}

If you ask me for a meeting, I will push you to see if it can be done asynchronously. 

### Never urgent
{:.no_toc}

I will never act on something as if it's urgent, unless you explicitly say it is. 

## Bookmarks Bar

Optimizing the bookmarks bar in my Browser has really made my life much easier. I have never used the Bookmarks Bar before (and still don't on my personal laptop). From left to right, here's what lives on my Bookmarks Bar:

* Group Conversation Agenda
* My 1:1 with my Manager
* CoST issue board
* Primary project issue board
* Create New Issue in Data Project
* Data page in the handbook
* MRs assigned to me
* MRs authored by me but not assigned to me, so I can follow up with the assignees
* Create New Issue in the CoS Project
* KPI page in the handbook
* CoS Team page in the handbook
* Time tracking doc
* (Changes based on what I'm working on)

## Technical Workflow

I wrote [the data team's onboarding script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/admin/onboarding_script.sh) based mostly on my own workflow preferences. 

* I use iTerm2 as a terminal client with tmux 
* I use atom as my text editor, but I'm working to transition to vim
* Since I don't use my work email for email, I use it as my GitLab notification manager. I only clear out my GitLab todos once per week.

## Work and Communication style

Even though they're descriptive not prescriptive, these sort of communication assessments make it easier to communicate with other folks about how I generally approach situations or interactions.
These assessments do not give people excuses to be jerks.

#### DISC Assessment

Here is my DISC Assessment from July 2019:

## Areas of Focus
While the list of *areas to improve* is long- infinite, even- I thought I'd take a second to highlight three weaknesses that have the most negative impact on my work.
I've tried to internalize the GitLab Iteration value, especially this line from [Focusing on Improvement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#focus-on-improvement), "We believe great companies sound negative because they focus on what they can improve, not on what is working."
I believe the same can be true at the individual level.

Here are some feedback pieces I've received while at GitLab:
   * [Feedback Doc from January 2019](https://gitlab.com/emilie/emilie.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/static/pdfs/2019 Recommendations for Emilie - Google Docs.pdf): This came from my manager when I had been at GitLab for about 6 months.
   * [360 Feedback from January 2019](https://gitlab.com/emilie/emilie.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/static/pdfs/culture_amp_360_jan_2019.pdf): This came through CultureAmp when GitLab had an organization-wide 360.
   * [Feedback Doc from May 2019](https://gitlab.com/emilie/emilie.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/static/pdfs/Emilie Schario Handoff Doc - Google Docs.pdf): This came in the context of a manager handoff. I had been at GitLab for 11 months.
