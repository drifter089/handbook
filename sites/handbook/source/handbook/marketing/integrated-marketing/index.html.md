## Cadence of meetings within Integrated Marketing
{: #meetings .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR --> 
We value our asynch value and believe that people truly need time to think and process. The Integrated Marketing team, like all GitLab team members, should feel empowered to decline meetings based on the agenda topics. 

The IM team meets the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of the month and the time rotates between being EMEA/AMER & AMER/APAC timezons. We discuss key cross-functional issues, our progress on our OKRs for the quarter, and to ideate how we can better unify our marketing motions, as well as having a little fun getting to know each other! 

## Monthly Regional Readouts with Sales

Each month, Integrated Marketing meets with regional Sales Leadership to discuss key metrics and team updates.

[This GitLab Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/3352) (confidential) documents the past readouts as well as preparation for the future readouts monthly.

[See this doc for details on consistently pulling metrics for Monthly Regional Readouts (GitLab Internal)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcsPa8zRSY3A0sIocWBuukfC8LoUus-yUZoWc6ZYNck/edit#)

## Cross-functional team processes

### Publisher Programs
{: #publisher-programs .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->  
Due to the fact that teams outside of the digital marketing team are only allowed to run three paid social campaigns a month, we would not want to use one of our three slots for the month to run a publisher program with a publication that we already have relationship with. This is for two reasons: 1. To work with our 3rd party ad agency, there is 12-15% fee that is based off the ad spend of the publisher engagement to accommodate their services and reporting 2. because we do not want to take the place of a paid social campaign. Should we go down the route of wanting to work with a publisher, then the team member should collaborate by tagging the Campaign Manager & Digital team manager who you normally work with in the campaign issue. By tagging this team in your issue, the Campaign Manager & Digital team member will be able to ensure the publisher engagement does not conflict with existing activities running.
