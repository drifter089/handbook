## Setting Your Image

 The following settings are best completed when the camera is placed where you intend to record and your subject is in frame, with any lighting or adjustments already in place. The settings can all be easily reached on the LCD Touch Screen. Revise these steps every time you move your camera or adjust your light. 

### 1. Adjust Lens Zoom

1. Rotate the middle of the lens to zoom in or out as you frame your subject. 

### 2. Adjust Focus

1. Using the LCD Touch Screen, touch the face of the subject to set the camera focus. 

_Note: If the focus does not adjust, check that the auto focus switch, located on the lens, is set to ON. 

### 3. Adjust Shutter Angle

1. On the LCD Touch Screen, select **Shutter** near the top left of the screen. 
1. Use the touch screen controls to select a shutter angle of **180**

_Note: If your camera has been adjusted to display shutter speed instead, adjust the setting to **1/50**._

### 4. Adjust F-stop

 The f-stop adjusts how much light is allowed into the lens. 

1. On the LCD Touch Screen, select **F-stop** near the top left of the screen. 
1. Use the touch screen controls to select an f-stop of **4.0.**

### 5. Adjust ISO

1. With your camera in place and pointed at your subject, look at the Histogram at the bottom left of the LCD Screen. It looks like a horizontal bar with rolling white data. The left represents the darkest parts of your image and the right the brightest. 
1. On the LCD Touch Screen, select **ISO** near the top right of the screen. 
1. Adjust the **ISO** while referring to the Histogram. The contents of the histogram will shift right or left. Lower ISO values result in a better image, but require more light. 
1. Continue to adjust the **ISO** until the Histogram shows a decreasing slope on both ends, avoiding a vertical drop off. 

### 6. Adjust Audio Levels

1. Connect headphones to the camera using the port located on the left side of the camera, towards the top. 
2. Using the LCD Touch Screen, select the audio meters on the lower right side. 
3. Use the headphones to listen for any unwelcome noise in your audio. Common examples are clicking jewelry or watches against a desk or table, fans and vents, kitchen appliances turning on, or traffic. 
3. While your subject is speaking confidently, adjust the levels until they very gently enter the yellow portion of the meter. This will record at an appropriate level, while allowing room for futher noise should your subject laugh or exclaim something loudly.
