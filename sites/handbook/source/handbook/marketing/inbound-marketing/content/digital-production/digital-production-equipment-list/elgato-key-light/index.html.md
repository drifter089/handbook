# GVM Lights

## Operation 

GVM Panel lights should be operated in CCT mode only. In most cases, it will not be necessary to use any other features. 

1. Power the light by pressing the power switch to the right. 
1. **Press the right knob** to cycle modes until the LED display shows **CCT** on the second line. 
1. Use the left knob to adjust brightness.
1. Use the right knob to adjust the colour temperature (CCT). A lower value represents warm light, such as candlelight. A higher value reprsents cool light, such as sunlight. In almost every case, the desired colour temperature is 5000k or higher because it will compliment natural light from your windows. 
1. Ensure that each GVM light displays an identical CCT value.
