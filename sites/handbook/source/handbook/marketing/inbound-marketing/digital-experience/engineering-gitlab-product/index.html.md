# Engineering GitLab Product

## Overview

From time to time, our team has objectives that require us to collaborate on the [GitLab product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab).

### Onboarding

There is an existing onboarding process for GitLab engineering. Digital Experience engineers need to complete a specific subset of that onboarding.

While going through that onboarding subset, they should reach out and find an onboarding buddy. 

### Merge process

Merging code into the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) has a different set of procedures than our team's day-to-day process. During and after the onboarding tasks, read through and learn the process.
