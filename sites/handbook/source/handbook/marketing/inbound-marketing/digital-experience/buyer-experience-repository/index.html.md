# Content Editing Experience 

### Where Content Exists

All content is stored in the [/content](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content) directory and can be accessed via the [Nuxt content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)

### How to Edit Content

1. Edit content directly in the browser using [GitLab Web Editor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html).
1. Alternatively, set up a local development environment and use the [Nuxt content editing tools](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) on your machine. Then commit your changes and make a merge request in GitLab.
