# Content Editing Experience

All content is stored as `yml` with in the [/content](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content) directory.

### How to Edit Content

Edit content directly in the browser using GitLab editor tools. Editing the `yml` using GitLab editor tools will open a merge request for you! 

Here are the steps:

2. Cleck the blue "Edit in Web IDE" button in the upper right hand corner. Pro Tip: select the drop down arrow and choose "edit this file only" for a simpler single file UI editing experience. 
3. Make changes to the `yml`
4. Complete the commit message field at the bottom with a description of what changed and why. Link to any relative issues or merge requests.
5. Push that commit changes button!
