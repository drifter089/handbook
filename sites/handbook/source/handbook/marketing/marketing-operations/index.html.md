Marketing Operations (MktgOps) supports the entire Marketing team to streamline processes and manage related tools. Due to those tools, we often support other teams at GitLab as well. MktgOps works closely with Sales Operations (SalesOps) to ensure information between systems is seamless, data is as accurate as possible and terminology is consistent in respective systems. Not only are we assisting with marketing operations but we are also involved in the operations of marketing, such as the budget and strategies.

Our team is structured as business partners to the rest of Marketing - see focus next to the names below.

**Slack channels**

We do not use or create tool-specific Slack channels (e.g. `#marketo`).

- [#mktgops](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/mktgops) - We use this channel for general marketing operations support, weekly marketing operations team standup updates, and key system status updates. We attempt to [avoid direct messages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages) where possible as it discourages collaboration. 
- [#hbupdate-mktgops](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/mktgops) - This channel is used to automatically post new [handbook updates](#handbook-updates) that have been merged.

### Issues

The MktgOps team works from issues and issue boards. If you are needing our assistance with any project, please open an issue and use the ~MktgOps::0 - To Be Triaged label anywhere within the GitLab repo. Prior to opening a new issue, feel free to reach out to your business partner to see if there is already a related issue that you can add your comments to. If you have a bug, error or discrepancy you'd like the team to help and investigate, please use the [bug-request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/bug_request.md).

With [Agile Delivery](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/agile-delivery/) being one of the solutions that GitLab (as a product) addresses, the Marketing Operations team aims to follow many of the agile methodologies. To help us in that effort, please create any Marketing Operations issues in the following format.

**Note:** This format is the [Agile user story](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-story-template/) format and helps the issue-requester (you) and the MOps team by clearly stating **what** as well as **why** for each request and concern.

**Format:** `As a _____ (role in marketing), I would like to ____________(need), so that ________________(reason).`

Please note that there is now a new [Marketing Strategy and Performance project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-strategy-performance) for tracking work around Marketing overall strategy as well as reporting, dashboards and analysis.

### Epics

In order to categorize various related issues, we will make use of epics to help a team member organize our work, especially if it crosses multiple milestones. If it is a MktgOps epic, we will add the `In Epic` label to it, so that we can easily see that it is part of an epic on our kanban board.

### Labeling

We use labels for three purposes:

1. Categorize the tool or area that is affected
1. Show priority
1. Identify the stage they are in

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
Categories
</summary>

- `MktgOps - FYI`: Issue is not directly related to operations, no action items for MktgOps but need to be aware of the issue
- `MktgOps - List Import`: Used for list imports of any kind - event or general/ad hoc (do not also use To Be Triaged scoped label)
- `Marketo`, `Bizible`, `Cookiebot`, `Demandbase`, `Drift`, `GDPR`, `LeanData`, `LinkedIn Sales Navigator`, `Outreach-io`, `PathFactory`, `Periscope`, `Terminus Email Experiences`, `ZoomInfo`, `Smartling`, `Vimeo`, `OneTrust`, `Typeform`: used to highlight one of our tech stack tools
- `In Epic`: bright yellow label to show that it is part of a MktgOps epic
- `MktgOps - bug`: A bug issue to be addressed or identified by MktgOps
- `MktgOps - changelog`: Used to track issues or epics that would need to be logged in the marketing changelog to track major changes across marketing
- `MktgOps-Future Feature`: Something to consider for a future project as time allows. Timeframe: As time allows

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
Priorities
</summary>

- `MktgOps-Priority::Top Priority`:  Issue that is related to a breaking change, OKR focus, any other prioritized project by Mktg OPS leadership. This category will be limited because not everything can be a priority.Timeframe: Immediate action needed.
- `MktgOps-Priority::High Priority`: Issue has a specific action item for Mktg OPS to be completed as it is an OKR.Timeframe: Within Weeks
- `MktgOps-Priority::Med Priority`: Issue is a feature to help the team. Timeframe: Within Months
- `MktgOps-Priority::Low Priority`: Issue has a specific action item for Mktg OPS that would be helpful, but can be pushed for other issues. Timeframe: Within months.

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
Urgency
</summary>

- `MktgOps-Urgency::P0`: Immediate urgency, system down type issue. Timeframe: Immediate action needed
- `MktgOps-Urgency::P1`: Major feature or workflow is not working. Timeframe: Action within days
- `MktgOps-Urgency::P2`: Requires attention, but normal workflow is not impacted or there is a workaround. Timeframe: Action within 2-3 milestones
- `MktgOps-Urgency::P3`: Minor, low urgency. Timeframe: Future action needed, not priority or urgent

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
Stage
</summary>

- `MktgOps::0 - To Be Triaged`: Issue initially created, used in templates, the starting point for any label that involves MktgOps (except for List Uploads); no real discussion on the issue; generally unassigned
- `MktgOps::1 - Planning`: Issues assigned to a MktgOps team member and are currently being scoped/considered but are not being actively worked on yet.
- `MktgOps::2 - Scoping`: Marketing Operations related issues that are currently being scoped and weighted
- `MktgOps::3 - On Deck`: Issues that have been scoped/considered and will be added to an upcoming iteration/milestone.
- `MktgOps::4 - In Process`: Issues that are actively being worked on in the current two-week sprint/milestone.
- `MktgOps::5 - UAT`: Issues that MktgOps has completed its required tasks for and is ready for User Acceptance Testing/review and approval by the Requester/Approver.
- `MktgOps::6 - On Hold`: Issue that is not within existing scope of Mktg OPS current focus, or another department as deprioritized. May be a precursor to being closed out.
- `MktgOps::7 - Blocked`: Issue that was being worked on by Mktg Ops and at least one other team wherein MktgOps is waiting for someone else/another team to complete an action item before being able to proceed. Could be locked by MktgOps-related task/issue, or external (non-GitLab) blocker.
- `MktgOps::8 - Completed`: MktgOps has completed their task on this issue although the issue may not be closed. The hope is that we will be using this one less as we simply scope an issue so that MktgOps can just close it when complete.

</details>

### Milestones

The MktgOps team works in two week sprints/iterations which are tracked as milestones at the `GitLab.com` level. Each Ops individual contributor (IC) is responsible for adding issues to the milestone that will be completed in the two week time frame. If needed, the IC will separate the main issue into smaller pieces that are _workable_ segments of the larger request.

The MktgOps team will only create a milestone one beyond the current iteration, so at any given time there will be the **current** milestone and **upcoming** milestone, any other issue that is not included will be added into future milestones &/or added as work is completed in the current milestone.

A milestone cannot be closed nor marked complete until the milestone's accompanying merge request has been merged. Within every milestone there is a `WIP` merge request with all commits being changes to our handbook. All team members contribute their changes to the milestone merge request. The merge request should be tagged with marketing operations labels and the current milestone.

  </div>
</div>

### Handbook Updates

When making an update to a handbook page for `ABM`, `FMM`, `MOps`, or `SDR` handbook pages (or sub-pages), we have a Zapier workflow set up that will push the MR (upon merge) to the related Slack channel to ensure our teams are aware of any change that is made to the page. In order for the merged MR to show up in the respective Slack channel, you must add one of the following corresponding `labels` on the MR. Slack updates will also trigger for MktgOps MRs when created.

| Label you add | Slack channel the merged MR pushes to |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `MktgOps - HB Update` | `#hbupdate-mktgops` `#mktgops` |
| `FMM-HB Update` | `#fieldmarketing-FYI` |
| `SDR-HB Update` | `#hbupdate-sdr` |
| `ABM-HB Update` | `#hbupdate-abm` |

**Please Note:** The marketing operations team uses 2 collective merge requests (1 per week in a milestone), known as our milestone MRs, to make multiple updates across our handbook, see high-level updates in 1 MR, and avoid conflicts with each other. Here is an [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/71109).  We list all major changes with our GitLab username in the description after a commit and link any relevant issues that the commit closes out. If you have an update for the marketing operations handbook, please feel free to use our milestone MR to make a commit and tag us for review to avoid conflicts.

### Marketing Ops Calendar

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_u3gaaimqhrc3d753nbol3houkg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

### Focus Fridays

The Marketing Operations team had started an experiment on 2020-04-20 to commit to no internal meetings one day of the week. Now the entire Marketing team has moved to [Focus Fridays](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#focus-fridays). Please try not to schedule meetings for team members on Fridays, so they can devote time for deep work in milestone-related issues. 

### Marketing Changelog

Periodically Marketing Operations and other teams through the marketing org make significant changes to our system and processes that affect overall tools, data and reporting or uncovers significant changes that affected reporting. As such we have a shared [changelog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FHiKhQukMVfwKsBJDzyrsuzuw2bv97xQFhegvFXTeNQ/edit#gid=0). The MktgOps and Strategy/Perf teams update this document as needed as changes are made. If you are working on an issue or epic that will have a significant impact across marketing, add the label `MktgOps - changelog` so marketing oeprations can track changes across GitLab.

### PagerDuty and Emergency Comms

In any given week, there will be at least 1-2 team members scheduled for PagerDuty.

If a security incident occurs, Marketing Ops supports multiple teams as part of the [security incident communication plan](handbook/engineering/security/security-operations/sirt/security-incident-communication-plan). Follow directions on this [page](/handbook/marketing/emergency-response) to initiate the emergency response, and contact us via: `@mktg-ops` in Slack. For urgent issues, like a security incident, page the on-call Marketing Ops via entering `/pd` trigger command in any Slack channel and select `Marketing Ops Ext. Comms - Emergency`.

### Requesting access to an existing tool

To request access to an existing tool in the stack, [please follow the access request process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/) as outlined in the business operations handbook.

If you are working with a contractor or consultant that requires access to a tool in our stack, [please follow the professional services access request process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-contract-professional-services/#-step-7--create-professional-services-access-request-optional) as outlined in the procurement handbook.

### Requesting a new tool

If you are interested in or would like to request a new tool be added to the tech stack, [please submit an issue using the tools eval issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/issues/new?issuable_template=tools_eval) in the Marketing Operations repository. Marketing Operations should be included in new tool evaluations to account for system integrations, budget, etc. Any new tools desired after the budget is set will be handled by transferring budget from the other department to Marketing Operations.

### Tool usage and tool access

For budgetary reasons, Marketing Operations will be performing quarterly, and for some tools bi-quaterly, audits on the user activity of marketing tools. If a team member has not been actively taking advantage of a tool for 45 days or more, they will have access to that tool revoked without notification. Activity will be determined by user reports pulled by the tools' admins. These reports can be found by viewing issues from the Marketing Ops project with the issue label `Mktg Tool Audit`. The reports will utilize the audit issue template from the Marketing Ops project. To regain access to revoked tools, the team member will need to submit a new access request and follow standard access request procedures. However, user seats will be on a first-come-first-serve basis unless it is determined additional seats should be purchased.

## <i class="fas fa-receipt" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Marketing Expense Tracking

| **GL Code** | **Account Name** | Purpose |
| ----------- | -----------------| ------- |
| 6060 | Software Subscriptions | All software subscriptions |
| 6100 | Marketing  | Reserved for Marketing GL accounts |
| 6110 | Marketing Site | All agency fees and contract work intended to improve the marketing site |
| 6120 | Advertising | All media buying costs as well as agency fees and software subscriptions related to media buying |
| 6130 | Events | All event sponsorships, booth shipping, event travel, booth design, event production as well as agency fees and software costs related to events |

| 6150 | Brand | All PR, AR, content, swag and branding costs |
| 6160 | Prospecting | Not used - All costs related to prospecting efforts |

### Invoice Approval

Marketing Operations approves any invoices that have not already been coded and approved through a Finance issue or that exceed the original cost estimate. We make use of Tipalti for this process. Team leads will confirm that services were performed or products were received also through Tipalti. Campaign tags are used to track costs related to events and campaigns.

## Lead Scoring, Lead Lifecycle, and MQL Criteria

A Marketing Qualified Lead is a lead that has reached a certain threshold, we have determined to be 100 points accumulated, based on demographic/firmographic and/or behavioral information. The `Person Score` is comprised of various actions and/or profile data that are weighted with positive or negative point values. `Person Score` is one of the indicators used by LeanData to determine whether a lead needs to be assigned. Details about this process can be found on the [LeanData page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/leandata/#lead-routing-workflow). You can find more details about the scoring model on the [Marketo Page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#scoring-model)

## Campaigns and Programs

Campaigns are used to track efforts of marketing tactics - field events, webcasts, content downloads. The campaign types align with how marketing tracks spend and align the way records are tracked across three of our core systems (Marketo, Salesforce and Bizible) for consistent tracking. Leveraging campaigns aligns our efforts across Marketing, Sales and Finance.

Go to the [Campaigns and Programs Page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#campaigns) to view all of the campaign types, their progression statuses and cost tracking. That page also includes directions for set up in Marketo and Salesforce.

## Email Management

Email database management is a core responsibility for MktgOps. Ensuring GitLab is following email best practices, in compliance with Global spam laws and overall health of active database are all priorities.

Email creation and email nurture programs are managed by the Campaign Team. To learn more about GitLab email communication or request an email, please see the [Emails/Nurture Handbook](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/emails-nurture/) in the demand generation section of the handbook.

### Email Communication Policy

Please [visit the legal page](/handbook/legal/marketing-collaboration/#marketing-rules-and-consent-language) to view all of the Marketing Rules and Consent Language.

At GitLab, we strive to communicate with people in a way that is beneficial to them. We always include the unsubscribe link in our communications, and we respect the unsubscribe list. In addition to the unsubscribe button at the bottom of all of our emails, we have available our [Email Subscription Center](/company/preference-center/), where people can control their email communication preferences.

Certain emails can bypass unsubscribe and invalid emails by being marked as `operational`. Examples include critical system alerts, account updates (policy updates, etc.), event reminders with necessary link to attend event, and auto-responders for post event recording and slides emails. Please folloow this decision tree for auto-responder emails to help determine whether or not your email fits the operational standards. If they do not, you must include the proper email compliance filters in order to send the email, and also uncheck the operational check box on the email.

Emails that contain mostly marketing or promotional content like newsletters, event invites and sales emails are not considered `operational`. Only Mops and certain MCMs have access to this feature in Marketo. If you have any questions on whether or not your email is operational, contact MOps. **When in doubt, ask!** [This Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1609875791482/41f0f728c4353fce6b50338f7ca7cc032acf1f11) contains examples to help you make your decision.

`Operational Emails` do not have an effect on the communication limits in marketo. Those limits are set so a recipient cannot receive more than 2 emails per day, and/or 7 emails per week. Once a person has hit that limit, they are supressed from email groups until they fall back under the threshold, **unless** the email is marked as `operational`.

### Types of Email

**Breaking Change Emails**
These are transactional emails, almost always to our user base, that provide very selective needed information. This is an `operational` email that overrides the unsubscribe and would not need to comply with marketing email opt-out. Usage example: GitLab Hosted billing change, Release update 9.0.0 changes, GitLab Page change and Old CI Runner clients.

It is very important to have Engineering and/or Product team (whoever is requesting this type of email) help us narrow these announcements to the people that actually should be warned or notified, so we are communicating to a very specific focused list. The email platform the send will come from will be determined by a few different factors, but mainly list size. If you need to request an email like this, use this the `incident_communications` [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new#incident_communications) and reference [this section](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#pagerduty-and-emergency-comms).

**Newsletter**
Sent bi-monthly (every 2 weeks), the newsletter is a collaboration between the Content Team and the Campaigns Team. [Learn more here!](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/emails-nurture/#newsletter) Users can [subscribe to the newsletter](/company/contact/) on the website.

**Security Releases**
Sent on an as needed basis containing important information about any security patches, identified vulnerabilities, etc. related to the GitLab platform. These emails are purely text based and again are transactional in nature.  Users can [subscribe to security notices](/company/contact/#security-notices) on the GitLab Contact us page.

**Webcasts**
Invitation and/or notification emails sent about future webcasts.

**Live Events**
Invitation emails to attend a live event, meet-up, or in-person training. These emails are sent to a geo-locational subset of the overall segment. This type of email is also used when we are attending a conference and want to make people aware of any booth or event we may be holding and/or sponsoring.

## Initial Source

`Initial Source` is the first "known" touch attribution or when a website visitor becomes a known name in our database, once set it should never be changed or overwritten. For this reason Salesforce is set up so that you are unable to update the `Initial Source` field. If merging records, keep the `Initial Source` that is oldest (or set first). When creating Lead/Contact records and you are unsure what `Initial Source` should be used, ask in the `#mktgops` Slack channel. `Initial Source` in Marketo is named `Person Source`, and should only update when empty.

The values listed below are the only values currently supported. If you attempt to upload or import leads or contacts into Salesforce without one of these initial sources you will encounter a validation rule error. If you think that there needs to be a new Initial Source added to this list and into Salesforce please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new) with the marketing ops team.

The `Initial Source` table below is current as of 7 July 2020.

Status in the table below means:

- Active = can be selected from picklist
