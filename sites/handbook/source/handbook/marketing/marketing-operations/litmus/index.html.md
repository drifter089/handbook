## Uses

Litmus is email marketing software used primarily by lifecycle marketing to build, test, and optimize our email marketing programs. 

## Access and access requests

We currently have an Enterprise subscription. This provides 5 `Admin`, `Full`, `Code editor`, or `Content editor` users provisioned to the account. `Reviewer` and `Proof reviewer` users are unlimited.

To request access to Litmus, follow the [AR process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request). Be sure to indicate the role you are requesting in your AR.

Please note that if you are requesting `Proof reviewer` access, no AR is required. You will be added automatically when you are requested to review a proof.

## Litmus Proof
Our enterprise account provides access to Litmus Proof. This allows users to share emails for testing, commenting, and approval with an unlimited amount of reviewers. 

Litmus provides extensive documentation of the feature in their [help documentation](https://help.litmus.com/category/76-proof).

Any `Full` or `Admin` user can create a Proof for review. 
1. From the email, click the `Proof` tab
1. Select `Share`
1. Select existing users, or enter the email address of a new reviewer. If you enter an email address, this will invite the person as a `Proof Reviewer` and does not count towards our user count. The person will then be added to the account and will be available for selection from the list for future proofs.
1. You can enter a note, including due dates if you would like.

As a `Proof reviewer`, you will be notified via email that a proof is ready for your review. Click on the link and the Proof page will open for you. 

To review, click anywhere on the email and the comment section will open. You can also check the links in the email by clicking where the link should be and selecting `Visit link`. If you would like to leave a comment, click again and select `Add comment` instead. If the email is approved, click the green `Approve` button at the top of the page.
