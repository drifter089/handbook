### About Outreach

Outreach is a sales engagement platform helps efficiently and effectively engage prospects to drive more pipeline and close more deals.

### Set-Up  

##### Non-admin users
User set-up instructions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJpZaoDoGtwN4Dp21g_OuhVauN2prHNyUtmIWKuROUY/edit#heading=h.v6blhaepsusl).

##### Admin users
When provisioning new users or altering current users' credentials for role changes, there are a few things to keep in mind:
- A user's SFDC profile  cannot be loaded into Outreach for up to 24 hours after creation in Salesforce. However, the profile will automatically create in Outreach and will just need to be unlocked. The new user will also need to be added to the [Google Okta Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gitlab.com/g/okta-outreach-users) for access
- When adding a new user into Outreach, immediately place them in their appropriate Teams via the admin menu. When a user changes roles, remember to move them to the appropriate Team
- When a current user changes roles, sales-ops will create a new SFDC profile for their new role. These means _every_ role change will require remapping between Outreach profiles and SFDC profiles. Remap a user by:
    - Proceed to `Plugins` under Outreach settings
    - Click into the `Salesforce` plugin, then select `User`, followed by `Mappings`
    - Locate the user that needs to be altered. The search box does not work as of April 2021 so it will be a manual search. Sorry for the difficulty, friend!
    - Select the dropdown and click `Remove` to completely remove the mapping between Outreach and Salesforce
    - Select `Add`, type in the Salesforce and Outreach names to complete the new mapping. Be sure to double check you selected the correct `SFDC ID` before hitting save

### Learning Pathways
Outreach provides educational courses via their [Outreach University Pathways](https://university.outreach.io/) programs that are updated frequently with new content. While GitLab does not require the SDR team to pursue completion of Outreach University Pathways, it's recommended for longterm users to pursue mastery of any marketing tools we use.

### Sequences  
Sequences are one of the main features of Outreach. Users can create a series of touchpoints in order to communicate and automate their workflows.
We currently have two types of sequences. Primary and personal. Primary sequences are created to be shared and used across teams. Personal are for your own use.

Naming convention for primary sequences include the following:

- REGION (WW, AMER, EMEA, APAC)
- PRIMARY or PERSONAL
- Language
- Name of campaign
- HIGH or LOW touch

Example: | **EMEA PRIMARY English Just Commit HIGH**

When creating a new primary sequence or shared event sequence, please tag marketing ops on the issue for QA review prior to enabling it. The sequence is reviewed to ensure it has the correct rulesets, tags, collections, throttles, variables and other settings. Personal sequences do not need to be reviewed unless you wish to have an additional pair of eyes on it.

### Sequence Settings
You may choose the best delivery schedule and ruleset applicable to your goals. 
You may choose whether or not others can see and use your sequence or if you would like to keep it private. 
All sequence must have Throttle's enabled. This helps to stagger the volume of prospects moving through a sequence at one time. 
It is necessary to help prevent users from hitting the email provider's mailing limits. 
If you have too much volume this may result in you being kicked out of your email inbox by our provider. 
**Max adds per user every 24 hours are to be set up to 75.** 
If you need to request special sequence settings please reach out to Marketing Operations with your use case.

### Collections
Collections are an easy way to group sequences, snippets, and templates that get assigned to user groups for easier access. 
Examples associated to our SDR groups include our `SDR Inbound 2020` and `2020 Events` collections. 
You may request new collections by opening an issue in the Marketing Operations Project.

### Rulesets
- **Default** - Does not make tasks on your behalf. Prospects can be added to these sequences more than once, if not already active. prospects are not able to be added to other exclusive sequences, but can be added to a non-exclusive sequence. Updates prospoects to appropriate stages. Resumes out of office prospects after 5 days.
- **Campaign** - Follows the same rules as the default settings except out of office are resumed 1 day after.
- **Create Call Task** - Follows same rules as the default except it will create call tasks on opened emails. Minimum email opens needed: 2
- **Event** - Prospects can only be added to this sequence once. They are not exclusive to this sequence. Out of office are resumed 1 day after.

### Tips and Tricks
- `Snippets` are an easy way to save time when constructing emails. If there are frequent statements or phrases being sent to prospects, check if any team members have created a `snippet` related to that topic. If creating new, universally helpful `snippets`, remember to set permissions to `Others can see and use` and apply a `Collection`, where applicable.
- Many of the `Master` sequences have been set to work in specific timezones. Those in `AMER` should not be using sequences set to `APAC` timezones. 
- `Variables` allow Outreach to auto-populate prospect data and sender data, increasing productivity via automation. Pay close attention to what `variables` are available when composing emails and what information the `variables` will populate. If a prospect in Salesforce says "No Company" in the `Company` field, the Outreach `variable` for `company` will populate "No Company" in the sent email. 
- If the name within the `company` field of Salesforce and Outreach does not flow naturally in conversation, check to see if a `Company Natural Name` can be added. For example, "Mr Bob's Company Incorporated" sounds less natural in conversation than "Mr Bob's". When using a natural name, use the `variable` {{company_natural}} in the email template instead of {{company}}.
- `Variables` can also be used for setting `manual tasks` within an email template. However, these `manual tasks` function differently than a normal `variable`. After the brackets at the beginning of the `variable`, a "!" needs to be added or Outreach will attempt to populate the phrase inside the brackets. For example, a `manual task` should read {{! Edit this email before sending}}. If the "!" is not added, the sequence will fail with a "Template Syntax Error" message. 
- The `Accounts` tab is a useful way of browsing Outreach `prospects` + `accounts` where the SDR's name appears in the SFDC Account field `SDR Assigned`. This won't filter for **every** prospect under your ownership (limitations with leads or unassigned accounts may apply), but it will show many relevant prospects. This view won't be available at your first login to Outreach, so you'll need to create it. To create the view, 
    - Select the `Accounts` section of Outreach 
    - Next to the search box there is a purple label that reads `Owner is you`. Remove this filter for now
    - Select `Add filter` and type `SDR Assigned`. Type in your name and hit enter. Change the `Sorted by` option, if you wish 
    - From there, select `Save view`. From this window, you can edit the view name and privacy settings
    - It's best to set this view as your `default view`. Without this filter in place, the `Accounts` section's usefulness is primarily steered away from `SDRs` and moreso to Sales team members. 

### Outreach Meetings
The current meeting templates will sync to an SFDC event. Please be aware that Outreach will only create SFDC events for meetings `Booked from Outreach`. Per Outreach's [support documentation](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001407934-How-To-Configure-a-Meeting-Booked-Trigger-in-Outreach-), `Booked from Outreach` is defined as "The meeting was booked using the Outreach Public Calendar Link, insert availability, or by sending an invite through Outreach." This is important for SDRs to keep in mind to ensure any [Initial Qualified Meetings (IQMs)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/#qualified-meeting) are tracked appropriately.

|Meeting Type|Use Case|Notes|
|----|----|----|
|IQM (30)|For qualified prospects being sent from the SDR team to Sales to determine next steps with GitLab.| If no template is selected in the drop down this is the default meeting type used.|
|Discovery Call (30)|To be used as an intro call for potential clients and qualify their needs.|
|Evaluation Orchestration Call (25)|A deeper dive into a potential clients needs.| 25 minute evaluation.|
|Evaluation Orchestration Call (45)|A deeper dive into a potential clients needs.|This is a longer duration at 45 minutes rather than 25.|
|Pricing Call (25)|This is for potential clients who want to know about GitLab pricing. May also be used for renewal discussion with current clients.|

Outreach is able to sync some custom information about these meetings into events including:

|Event Field|Notes|
|----|----|
|`Subject`|If using a template the subject line is provided as the `Title` of the meeting.
|`Description`|If using a template the `Description` is already filled in for you. If not it will be whatever you are writing to who you are inviting to the meeting.
|`Location`|The zoom link associated to the meeting.
|`Start Date`|Date and time the meeting is booked for.
|`End Date`|Date and time the meeting ends.
|`Name of Prospect`|This is the person who is attending the meeting.
|`Owner of the Meeting`|Who the meeting is assigned to.
|`Related Opportunities`|When booking meetings you can associate the event to an open opportunity.
|`Outreach Meeting Type`|This displays the name of the meeting template used for the meeting.
|`Booked By`|If you book a meeting on someone else's behalf this displays the name of the person who booked it.
|`Attributed Sequence Name`|The last known sequence name will be brought over into this field.|
|`Meeting Source`|The Source field will display one of two values (App or Sync) so that you can distinguish whether a meeting was booked through Outreach or if it was booked prior to connecting with Outreach and retroactively synced back to SFDC.|
|`Meeting Cancelled`|Outreach can not delete events in SFDC. If a meeting is deleted within Outreach it will check the `Meeting Cancelled` checkbox.|

### Sending Email Using Outreach   

Outreach is **not** meant for mass communications nor bulk email sends it is intended for very targeted account and prospect communications. The Outreach platform is directly integrated to the GitLab Gmail account and each users email is linked through OAuth therefore all activity in Outreach has the potential to impact the IP reputation of the GitLab domain with all major email services providers.   

As such there are [sending limits built into the Outreach platform](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/205022518-Individual-Email-Limits-Safeguards) as well as [limits put in place by Gmail itself](https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852?hl=en).   

#### Sending Limits   
* Individual users can send up to 2,000 emails *combined* between Outreach and Gmail inbox in a rolling 24-hour period.    
    * This is the maximum across both systems, if you max out in Outreach, you **will be** maxed out in Gmail.   
* Outreach has a **hard limit** of 5,000 emails in a rolling seven day period.  
    * If you max out in Outreach, your emails will be queued to try again in 24 hours, when your account drops below this hard limit.

### Importing SFDC Reports

Step 1:
Create your SFDC report and save it into the `Unfiled Public Reports` folder.
- Report can only be a lead or contact report
- Limit to 2000 records per import
- Minimum Required fields:
    - Lead ID
    - Email
    - First Name
    - Last Name
 - Note: you may only map fields that already exist within Outreach, but the import is set up to load additional data points during the upload. You do not need to create your report with a bunch of fields to get them into Outreach.
  
Step 2:
Navigate to the &#9889;Quick Actions button and choose `Bulk Create`.
- Select your `Import Type` as `Prospects Salesforce Report`
- You will need to enter the report ID or choose the name of your report from the dropdown
- Choose the frequency as `Once`

Step 3:
Next you will review the mapping of the above 4 fields in the Outreach plugin. These usually auto-populate if Outreach can determine the correct field.
   - If a field is not mapped please select it from the drop down
     - If you need additional guidance while mapping please contact Marketing Operations
   - Please do not try to map fields that do not exist already in Outreach it is ok to the leave these fields as `Not mapped`
   - Outreach will prompt you that there are unmapped fields and you can hit continue

Step 4:
On the next screen you will be prompted with more fields. To prevent from overriding important data please select the following:
- Owner - `Use owner from data`
- Stage - `Use stage from data`
- Timezone - Leave blank
- Source - Leave blank
- Additional Tags: You may assign tags as you need them
- Load additional data from Salesforce - Prechecked check box
- What to do with duplicates? - `Skip`

Step 5:
Select the `Start Import` button on the next screen.

### Outreach Stages
Outreach stages are a 1:1 match with SFDC Status. The rulesets help push prospects along into the correct stage/status based on their actions. This eliminates the need for triggers to match status to stage.

### Outreach Automation
Outreach will make updates based on these scenarios. Triggers fire in order of operation.

| Trigger Name | Prospect Conditions | Account Conditions | Trigger Actions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|00 - Inactive Contact and Lead|Inactive Contact or Lead Checkbox is True||Stop All Sequences
|01 - Community Queue|Owner is Community Queue||Stop All Sequences
|02 - Set Nurture Status Reason|Stage is `Nurture`| |Set `Nurture ` Status Reason to `No response`
|03 - Set Unqualified Status Reason|Stage is `Unqualified`||Set `Unqualified` Status Reason to `Unsubscribe`
|04 - Set Bad Data Status Reason|Stage is `Bad Data`||Set `Bad Data` Reason to `Bounced email`

### Outreach Merge and Delete

Outreach will automatically merge and delete lead, contact, and account information based on those actions taking place in SFDC. Outreach checks for these data changes in SFDC once a day.

If a lead or contact is currently in an active sequence Outreach will let that lead or contact finish the sequence. This allows the SDR to complete their outreach if working on a duplicate prospect. Once a prospect has been marked as finished. The next time Outreach looks for changes in SFDC it will merge or delete the prospect accordingly.

Prospects that get deleted in Outreach live in the recycle bin until permanently deleted. Both Sales Enablement and Marketing Operations have the ability to remove leads from this recycle bin and bring them back into Outreach if there is ever a scenario that requires this action.

### Keeping Outreach Tidy

Marketing Ops will be responsible for pausing and locking sequences owned by former team members and for deleting tasks owned by former team members. The MktgOps team will also be responsible for monitoring and cleaning the SAL's and AE's unused sequences and overdue tasks, as necessary. Procedure for the former team members clean up process is as follows:
- During the deprovisioning process, any former team member with an Outreach profile will be added to the `Former Team Member` Outreach team. This instruction has been added to the deprovisioning template.
- Use the `Sort & Filter` function of Outreach to track tasks and sequences owned by members of the `Former Team Members` team. Tasks can be outright deleted, sequences deactivated and locked. Instructions for locking sequences below.
- If there are sequences owned by members of the `Former Team Members` team that are being used by current GitLab team members, change ownership of the sequence to a current team member. MktgOps users are preferred, but change to a team member using the sequence where appropriate.

SDRs are asked by SDR Leadership to periodically remove their older, unsued and inactive sequences from view and use. To qualify for clean up, a sequence needs to meet these criteria:
- There are no active prospects in the sequence
- If there are active prospects in the sequence, check the date when the prospects were added. If prospects have been stuck on a step or paused for a prolonged period of time, consider those prospects inactive
- The sequence has not been used in 13 months or longer
- The sequences must be marked by corresponding and correct tags and collections for ease of team cooperation, according to their data (market, account size, etc..). If there is a need, new collections and tags are to be created after consulting managers.

Outreach sequences are a useful source of a/b testing data for customer responses, so the best course of action is not to outright delete sequences. Instead, follow these steps:
- Deactivate/pause the sequence. If there are prospects still in the sequence, there will be a warning regarding the outcome of those prospects' path through the sequence. Assuming the prospects have been deemed inactive, proceed in deactivating the sequence
- From the `Sort & Filter` view, select the checkbox on all applicable sequences
- Proceed to the top of the page and click the padlock icon, which shows the Lock and Restore feature. Select [Lock to lock the unneeded sequences](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/115005151633-Locking-vs-Deleting-Sequences)

Congrats! You've just helped keep Outreach as a tidy tool for yourself and your teammates. Reward yourself with a tasty treat, if desired. 

### Outreach Database Management

Bi-quarterly, we will be deleting prospects out of Outreach with an aim of keeping Outreach clean. Below are the filters we will be using to delete out old prospects: 

|Filters | 
| ------ |
| Opted Outed Prospects | 
| Bounced- Invalid Email | 
| No email and no mobile number | 
| No email and created by ZoomInfo | 
| Bad Data- Invalid Email | 
| Bad Data- Spam | 
| Unqualified- Competitor | 
| Unqualified- No longer at company | 
| No SFDC ID | 
| Opted Out - No SFDC ID* | 

We are using triggers in Outreach to tag those that we included in the next round of deletion. If you see your prospect with a delete tag on it and feel it should not be, just remove the tag and it won't be included. For more details please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4TCW3yWMQTRDY1uV19WYOUUCzmmWjuZPX_w6zbS-Wg/edit?usp=sharing).
