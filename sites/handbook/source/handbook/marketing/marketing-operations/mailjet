### About MaailJet
[MailJet](https://www.mailjet.com/) is an email platform used for large transactional sends. It is replacing MailChimp as our large-scale sender. MailJet charges based on volume sent, not database size, so it is more cost effective (among other reasons) to use vs [Marketo](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/).

MailJet is used by only certain Marketing Ops and Marketing Campaigns users. It is currently being onboarded as of 2021-03-01, planning to have the IP warmed and the platform useable by mid-April 2021.

### Use Cases
- Large sends (50k) or more.
     - Security Incidents
     - Account Updates (Account and pricing notifications, etc)
     - Privacy Policy Updates
