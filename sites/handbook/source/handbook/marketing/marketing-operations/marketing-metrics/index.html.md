## Marketing Metrics

We use Sisense to view and analyze our marketing metrics from multiple data sources. 

## Marketing Sisense Dashboards
In [Sisense](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/403199/Welcome-Dashboard-%F0%9F%91%8B) there are mutlipe marketing metric dashboards. You can quickly find the current source of truth dashboards by referencing the `Marketing` topic within Sisense. There are 3 topics that marketing leverages:   
1. `Marketing` - These are the actively maintained dashboards.
1. `Marketing-WIP` - These are the WIP dashboards. They can be viewed but are not reliable yet.
1. `Marketing-Archive` - These are the archived/old dashboards. They are not to make decisions off of and no longer supported.

Below you can find a few of the major dashboards in use and descriptions/links of/to them. 

### Marketing sources

To help us improve our paid and organic campaigns, we split marketing activities out by source in to Inbound and Demand Generation related activity. Inbound and Demand Generation sources use the following breakdown.

#### Inbound
* Organic
* Direct/none
* Non-paid social
* Referral

#### Demand Generation
* Display
* Paid Social
* Generic Paid Search
* Branded Paid Search

### Defining Conversion Rate

There are several ways we can use conversion rate optimization to improve marketing performance on GitLab web properties. To create a common, [MECEFU](/handbook/communication/#mecefu-terms) oriented definition for our teams we use the following formulas.

**Overall conversion rate**
We use the overall conversion rate to quickly measure the effectiveness of our marketing website. This measurement helps us establish a baseline for engagement and move to update CTAs and offers across our marketing website to improve our conversion motions. This is the formula we use to arrive at the overall conversion rate.

overall conversion rate = `goal conversion events on about.gitlab.com/total sessions on about.gitlab.com`

For example, in December 2020 there were 2,829,601 sessions across our Google Analytics profile, with 23,218 goal conversion events.

Our overall conversion rate in December 2020 was 0.82% (23,218/2,829,601).

**Offer specific conversion rate** (trial, demo, etc)
We use offer specific conversion rates to help us measure the effectiveness of pages with conversion events. This includes our trial page, demo, webcasts, resources, and other pages we use to convert visitors to inquiries. We use this formula to calculate the offer conversion rate.

offer conversion rate = `offer conversion/visits to offer pages`

Looking at December 2020 again, there were 7,226 `/demo/` pageviews with 600 `demo` conversion events.

Our demo conversion rate in December 2020 was 8.3% (600/7,226).

### Marketing Metrics Dashboard

The [Marketing Metrics Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/431555/Marketing-Metrics) is the centralized hub of all major marketing metrics and [marketing KPIs](/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/#revenue-marketing-kpi-definitions). It is an evergreen source of information brought in from Salesforce that is comprised of numerous individual graphs/charts (defined below) and allows the viewer to quickly filter results using pre-defined filters on the dashboard itself.

### Marketing Attribution

The [Marketing Linear Attribution Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/556414/Marketing-Linear-Attribution) provides insight into the campaigns, channels, assets, forms and landing pages that drive our goals.

### Marketing trial sign up flow

We use a variety of methods and systems to collect leads and understand how people discover GitLab. This is a basic overview of these visitors move through marketing systems. 
Note: The time delay between a record being added to SFDC and the time it takes to process in Marketo, get a score, and get pushed back to SFDC as a MQL causes a discrepancy between Inquiries and MQLs for trials on a given day or in a given month (when the trial occurs on the first/last day of the month) when viewed on the [Marketing Metrics Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/431555/Marketing-Metrics).

## Filters on Marketing Dashboards
Filters are a native and integral piece of any dashboard! They allow you to quickly and easily isolate and filter your data based on pre-determined values and sets. They are of *no use* to anyone if we don't all know what a specific filter represents though! Here are the most common filters used on marketing dashboards, what data they pull from, and what they mean to you as the end-user!   

### Date Filters
1. DateRange - DateRange is the standard date filter in Sisense. Unless otherwise noted it is the X-axis of an individual chart. Note: DateRange works as an `after` filter of the first date, so if you want to see all of February 2020, your `DateRange` filter must be set to `2020-01-31 to 2020-02-29`.
1. Fiscal Quarter - this groups the X-axis dates (unless noted on the chart) by GitLab's [Fiscal Quarters](/handbook/finance/#fiscal-year)
1. Fiscal Year - this groups the X-axis dates (unless noted on the chart) by GitLab's [Fiscal Years](/handbook/finance/#fiscal-year)

### Salesforce Data Filters
All of these filters pull from the linked/specified field(s) from Salesforce. Notes will indicate when there are groupings used. As all of these pull directly from SFDC and are not cleaned (except for those specified as being bucketed/grouped, anomalies may occur when our data is not properly maintained in SFDC)
1. Sales Segment - this pulls from SoT for `Segment` for each object as shown below in the [Reporting Fields Source of Truth](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketing-metrics/#reporting-fields-source-of-truth) section.
1. Source Bucket - this pulls from the `Lead Source` for Leads/Contacts as shown below in the [Reporting Fields Source of Truth](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketing-metrics/#reporting-fields-source-of-truth) section. Note: these are grouped into **buckets** which, once updatd, will be displayed in a table below. This is considered the SoT for where a specific Lead/Contact came from/was sourced.
1. Sales Qualified Source - this pulls from the [Sales Qualified Source](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00N6100000HZPjd?setupid=OpportunityFields) of the Opportunity. This is considered the SoT for where an Opportunity came from/was sourced.
1. Opp Sales Type - this pulls from the [Type](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/_ui/common/config/field/StandardFieldAttributes/d?id=Type&type=Opportunity&retURL=%2Fp%2Fsetup%2Flayout%2FLayoutFieldList%3Ftype%3DOpportunity%26setupid%3DOpportunityFields&setupid=OpportunityFields) field on the Opportunity. It is used to define whether an Opportunity is `New Business`, `Add-On Business`, etc.
1. Net New Category_ToIgnore - this is a special exclusive filter used *only* for the `New Unique Emails Added` chart on the Marketing Metrics Dashboard. When `DiscoverOrg` is checked, no Leads/Contacts with `DiscoverOrg` as their `Lead Source` will be shown on that chart.

## Useful things to know when it comes to Sisense vs. SFDC data
Given the way that our systems are connected and synched, you may see a discrepancy in the data within Sisense vs. Sales Force.com. A few things to note: 
1. Opportunity amount will be updated immediately within sales force, but will NOT show up in Sisense until the next day, as our data synchs overnight. 
1. There is about a 7 hour time difference between Sisense and SFDC, so this time lag can also create discrepancies as well.
