### About Tweetdeck

Tweetdeck allows us to manage various GitLab twitter accounts, such as our movingtogitlab [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/movingtogitlab) and our gitlabstatus [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GitLabStatus).

## How to Request

For Tweetdeck access, team members will need their own Twitter accounts (using your gitlab.com email account). Those accounts will need to have 2FA authenticated. You can submit an AR by <insert>, which will require:

- the link to your personal twitter profile
- a screenshot showing 2FA is activated
