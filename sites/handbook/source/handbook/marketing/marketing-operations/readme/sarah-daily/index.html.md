### Sarah Daily's — README.md

I created this personal README document to help you get to know me and how I work. This document is inspired by Tim Hey's README and the Product team README's.

### About me

- My name is Sarah Daily (last name jokes are welcome and I've also had some people just call me `Daily`). I am a Senior Marketing Operations Manager on the [Marketing Operations team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/) at GitLab and I focus on content.
- I currently live in Pagosa Springs, CO.
- I was born and raised in northeastern Oklahoma.
- I am an [Advocate (INFJ-A / INFJ-T)](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) personality type.
- I studied media and convergence journalism at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Convergence journlism is just a fancy term to cover media in all channels (online and offline).
- I enjoy gaming in all its form (console, PC, board). I'm active on the `#gaming` Slack channel and I'm a huge fan of retro games and video game music. I have multiple playlists on Spotify solely dedicated to my favorite video game music.

### How I work

- My timezone is MST
- My typical working hours are 7 AM to 4 PM with a 1/2-hour to hour lunch break around 11 AM.
- I follow the Marketing Operations work cadence of 2-week sprints tracked as [Milestones](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#milestones).

### My typical week

- I reserve Friday for deep work related to current milestone issues. See [Focus Fridays](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#focus-fridays).
- I clean up my to-dos and MRs every Friday.
- I use [Clockwise](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#clockwise) to block focus time for me during the week.
- Every morning at 7 AM, I block an hour for personal development and coding. I'm currently using [Codeacademy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/#growth-and-development-benefit-eligibility) to brush up on JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Git, and Command Line.

### My typical day

- I get up at 6 AM on most days.
- I start working at 7 AM and take my first break around 11 AM.
- I typically address emails, to-dos, and Slack DMs first.
- I prefer to have meetings in the morning but will meet anytime during my normal working hours.
