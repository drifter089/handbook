### Account Deduplication

Account deduplication is currently being managed by Sales Ops. The deduplication job applies for Prospect Accounts w/o ZI Company ID and runs weekly every Saturday at 12:00 PDT. 

### Lead to Lead, Contact to Contact Deduplication

Lead to Lead and Contact to Contact deduplication is currently being managed by Marketing Ops and is in the final testing/troubleshooting phase before it's going to be rolled out. This is  will also be done through scheduled runs for different sub-sets of our leads/contacts databases with the goal of a full refresh/merge of duplicate of leads and contacts every quarter. 

### Lead to Contact Deduplication

Just as Lead to Lead and Contact to Contact deduplication, Lead to Contact Deduplication sits with Marketing Ops and is the final deduplication phase. As the naming implies this will make sure we have no duplicates between both objects (leads and contacts). This phase is to be finalised by end of Q3. 

## Current Process

The current process is currently being ironed out and will be detailed here once completed.
