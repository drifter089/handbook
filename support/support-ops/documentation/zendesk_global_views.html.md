## Overview

As per
[Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203690806-Creating-views-to-manage-ticket-workflow):

> Views are a way to organize your tickets by grouping them into lists based on
> certain criteria. For example, you can create a view for unsolved tickets
> that are assigned to you, a view for new tickets that need to be triaged, or a
> view for pending tickets that are awaiting response. Using views can help you
> determine what tickets need attention from you or your team and plan
> accordingly.

Currently, Zendesk has 3 view types:

* Default: Pre-defined views created by Zendesk
* Shared: Views created by the Zendesk Administrator(s) (ie. Support Ops)
* Personal: Views created by you and usable only by you

Currently, Zendesk views have some limitations:

* Only 12 visable views (Default and Shared) will be displayed.
* Views cannot use criteria that is not "defined", meaning it must be selectable
  data (text fields will not work, as an example).
* You can only display up to 8 personal views


## View management

Instead of managing Zendesk views via Zendesk itself, we instead use GitLab
itself via the
[zendesk-views project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-views).
This allows us to have version-controlled views. For more information on
managing Zendesk via the various GitLab projects, please review
[Using the sync repos](sync_repos.html).

## Moving tickets between views

The crieria for most views is centered around the form the ticket is using. But
there are some scenarios where the tags on a ticket can cause it to show in
multiple areas.

### Priority Prospects

As it is often impossible to tell where these tickets should live, there will
show in both Self-Managed and SaaS views. As such, there are two tags you can
add onto the ticket to help out here:

* `prospect_saas` will specificy it should only show in SaaS views.
* `prospect_sm` will specificy it should only show in Self-Managed views.

### Missing SLA

When the `missing_sla_tag` is present on a ticket, it will always show in the
Needs Org & Triage view. As this tag is a safety net to prevent tickets from
disappearing from all views, this tag is never removed automatically. As such,
you will need to ensure a SLA tag is present and then remove the tag to remove
it from the Needs Org & Triage view.
