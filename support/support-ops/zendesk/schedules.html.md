## Holidays

All schedules should utilize the same holidays. The ones we currently put into Zendesk are:

* Easter (this is a "moveable feast" holiday, so it changes each year)
* Christmas (December 25th)
* New Years Day (January 1st)

On those day, the schedules "stop", which results in the SLA clock not moving. This allows for Support to actually have those holidays "off".
