## Support Team Member Time Off
{: .no_toc}
The Support Team follows [GitLab's paid time off policy](/handbook/paid-time-off).
And we balance that with the need to deliver support to our customers every day.
This page is intended to provide all Support Team Members with an understanding
of what we need to do to achieve that balance, making it possible for all to
take time off as needed and desired while we as a team continue to deliver
amazing support and service to our customers.

There's a special point that needs to be emphasized, and that is that time off
for any team member only serves its purpose if that person truly takes the time
off. Nobody should feel pressure or the need to check Slack, email, or anything
else associated with work during their time off. **Especially when you are taking
time to be on holiday or to be with family or friends, please, in the timeless
words of the snow queen, Elsa, "let it go."**

### Responsibilities
When you are approaching a planned absence from work, it is your responsibility
to take reasonable actions to prepare the team and your customers for your
absence. By making these preparations, you will also be making it easier for
yourself to disconnect from work and make your time off effective.

#### Choosing time off
**MJD** Discuss guidelines around choosing time off and the need to take into consideration:
  - the needs of the team - too many people off at once will create problems.
  - schedule early for days that may be popular or that are particularly important to you
  - try to avoid booking travel itineraries until you know you can get the days off
  - if possible, plan time off to avoid disruptions to the various rotations
  - **what else?**

#### One-time actions
There are a few things you will need to do just once, before you take any time off.

1. Be sure you have access to the
[**Support - Time Off**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gitlab.com_as6a088eo3mrvbo57n5kddmgdg%40group.calendar.google.com)
team calendar.

   You should have been granted access when you joined Support. But
if you don't have it, please ask for help in the `#support_team_chat` channel
on Slack and someone will share the calendar with you.

1. Configure PTO Ninja to link to both your personal calendar and the
'Support - Time Off' calendar
   1. In Slack, click the `+` sign next to 'Apps' at the bottom of the left sidebar
   1. Search for 'PTO Ninja' and click 'View'
   1. Under 'Home', click on 'Connect your calendar'
   1. Click on 'Allow' and complete the actions to sync your calendar to PTO Ninja
      - You will see a 'Success! Your calendar has been connected.' message and
        your calendar listed under 'Your synced calendar' in PTO Ninja on Slack
      - ***NOTE: this also serves to block your availability in Calendly***
   1. After your personal calendar is linked, click 'Add calendar' under
   'Additional calendars to include?'. The 'Support - Time Off' calendar ID is
   `gitlab.com_as6a088eo3mrvbo57n5kddmgdg@group.calendar.google.com`

#### Taking off less than half a day

- please do so without hesitation -- go for a walk or run, grab a coffee, eat
lunch, go to an appointment, run an errand, or just plain take a brain break
- please do **not** add time-off events to the shared calendar or via PTO Ninja
- please *do* consider blocking off your own calendar so that customer calls or
other meetings won't be scheduled during your time away

#### Taking off half a day or more
For planned absences of half a day or more, you will need to take various steps
to communicate your absence, to reschedule planned events, to ensure continued
service to customers, and to arrange coverage for your assignments such as being
on call. The exact steps vary somewhat depending on the relative length of your
absence.

##### Start with these steps for all absences of at least half a day

1. Use PTO Ninja to schedule the time
   PTO Ninja uses your calendar links to block off time in your Google Calendar,
   which has the cascading effect that Calendly will also show you as busy. As a
   result:
   - Google Calendar invitations will be automatically declined
   - Calendly will not allow you to be assigned to Customer Calls
1. If you are assigned to any PagerDuty shifts (such as on-call) during the time
   you are taking off, arrange for coverage:
   1. Find a volunteer to cover for you; get help from your manager if necessary
   1. Create the appropriate override in PagerDuty
1. Reschedule or cancel any impacted meetings in which you are a key participant

##### Continue for absences of one or two days
**MJD** Flesh this out
- how to groom your queue

#### Three or more days off
**MJD** Flesh this out
- how to ramp down from taking tickets (while still helping with the queue)
- how to reassign tickets

- add an agenda item during the team meeting before your time off
- **MAY BE OBSOLETE** either specify your manager as the person who covers for you, or leave a note to ping `#support_managers` per [our escalation procedure](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/internal-support/#i-want-to-draw-attention-to-an-existing-support-ticket)

### Tips
**MJD** This whole section needs to be created
<!--
* unsubscribe from MRs that will likely resolve while you're gone - so the burden of your email & ticket queues is not high when you return
* Set up email filters to move emails into buckets that you can address one-at-a-time when you return
* log out from (or remove) Slack and Gmail from your phone https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C834CM4HW/p1594764888095700
