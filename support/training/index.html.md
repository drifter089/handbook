## Support Learning Pathways

All the learning pathways we have in Support are listed [here](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-subject.html). Each pathway contains a set of modules, and a module may reside in multiple pathways.

To create an issue for yourself with one of the module templates:

- Click on the module you want to pursue from the [Skills by Subject](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-subject.html) page
- Title it as **_Your Name_: _Module Name_**
- Assign it to yourself
- Now you're all set to follow the instructions in the module!

### Support Onboarding Pathway

When you first join the team everything will be new to you. Don't worry! In order to get you started with GitLab quickly, apart from the company wide onboarding issue that will be assigned to you on Day 1 by PeopleOps, we also have an onboarding program in Support. Note that you can simulataneously start both the company wide onboarding and the Support Onboarding.

It is recommended that you complete the modules in the order listed, unless an issue mentions that you can start something else simultaneously. Typically, for a new team member in Support, completion of the below onboarding modules should take **6 weeks**.

Once you complete the onboarding pathway modules, have a discussion with your manager on where your focus will be: depending on that, you have to complete either the [Self Managed Support Basics pathway](#self-managed-support-learning-pathway) **or** the [Gitlab.com SAAS Support Basics pathway](#gitlab.com-saas-support-learning-pathway). Please note that this extends your onboarding by 2 weeks, making the entire duration to be 8 weeks.

#### Reference Table for Achievable Progress - First 6 Months

Our onboarding pathway gives new Support Engineers an opportunity to learn at their own pace and explore. We strongly believe in learning by doing ([70/20/10 learning model](https://trainingindustry.com/wiki/content-development/the-702010-model-for-learning-and-development/)), and encourage Support Engineers to start contributing on tickets with public or internal comments from as early as your 3rd week. 

To help with that, the following reference table can be used as a guideline on what they can aim to achieve in their first few months in GitLab Support. This can also be used by managers as a reference on where they can expect to see their new hire in their first 6 months.

| Month | Public Comments Reference Range - Self Managed | Public Comments Reference Range - Dotcom |
| ------ |  ------ | ------ |
| 1 | 0-10 | 0-20 |
| 2 | 10-30 | 20-40 |
| 3 | 30-50 | 40-60 |
