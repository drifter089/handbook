# Support Onboarding Buddy

You've become an onboarding buddy to a new Support Engineer. In that case, congratulations! You've been granted a pivotal role in helping someone new learn about how to best contribute to our customers, our team, and our product.

## Responsibilities

These responsibilities of the Support onboarding buddy are an extension of [the onboarding buddy responsibilities](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/onboarding-buddies/#buddy-responsibilities), which you are expected to read first.

1. Help the new Support Engineer through any sticking points they have in their onboarding module.
1. Communicate often with the new hire and direct (or even help) them get help when stuck.
1. Help the new Support Engineer adapt to and learn the role by having frequent calls and pairing sessions to learn about its day-to-day duties.

## Structure

During your time as onboarding buddy, you'll be working alongside the new Support Engineer while they complete their onboarding.

**Weeks 1-2**
  - Call to meet the new Support Engineer and help them get acclimated, answer any general questions they may have, discuss schedules, and share anything they can find useful as they get started.
  - Open the lines of communication in Slack. Throughout this process, check in with them periodically to see how their onboarding module is progressing and if they need help.
  - Call to help them with update the team page, support-resources (dev-resources), the GDK, or anything else they may have questions about.

**Weeks 3-6**
  - Pair on tickets 2+ times. Aim to pair at least once a week.
  - Non-ticket pairings


## Ideas & Suggestions

Note that everyone's pace is different so consider the following as a list of ideas to customize to their individual needs. Not everyone needs everything from the below lists, but everyone would find at least a few of the following helpful.

### Calls during first 1-2 weeks

  - Meet and get to know each other
  - Answer general questions
  - Talk about your “schedule” and how you work every day - walk them through a few example days
  - Talk about how to use tools like Slack, Expensify, etc.
  - Show them some helpful Slack channels
  - Which Slack channels to keep track of daily
  - Which google docs to keep track of (SWIR, etc.)
  - Show them some helpful handbook pages to read during onboarding
  - Show them the GitLab architecture diagram
  - Show them some product or support-team-meta issues and clarify that they can contribute to anything
  - Remind them they can get reimbursed for any books or training, and show them the “spending company money” page. If it’s expensive, talk to their manager first.
  - Show them how to use dev-resources or support-resources
  - Update the team page with their info

### Ticket Pairing 1

Optionally created by the new SE in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/New-Support-Team-Member-Start-Here.md#support-engineer-onboarding-pathway

If not, it's the continuation from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Working-On-Tickets

  - Walk them through ZD and how to use it
  - Answer any questions they have about the ticket workflow docs
  - Walk through your process for choosing and answering tickets
  - Share your screen and answer a few easy tickets with them
  - Talk about setting a signature: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/team/-/merge_requests/15/diffs
  - Create a ticket pairing issue


### Ticket Pairings 2 onwards

- If they brought any tickets to the call, answer those first.
- Rotate who shares their screen and take on a few tickets
- Reproduce problems whenever you can. Show them how to quickly spin up an instance using your preferred method (Docker, support-resources, GCP, etc.)


### Non-ticket pairings

- Ping them when you have a customer call so they can shadow it.
- Show them how to find customer calls to shadow.
- Be available for their first customer call, if possible. If not, do what you can to ensure they have a shadow to help them out.


### What to do afterwards

- Over the first few months, if you have anything interesting you’re working on that you think they would find interesting, ping them and see if they’d like to pair/shadow you on it.
