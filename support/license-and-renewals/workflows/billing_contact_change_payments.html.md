## Overview

Billing and invoicing requests require action from our Billing/Accounts
Receivable team.

The following information is helpful to provide to the AR team when transfering
tickets, but not required.

1. Subscription #
1. Subscription information - copy & paste from `Manage Purchases` in
   [CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in)
1. Zuora ID - available in the [CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in)
   under the `Edit` tab
1. Salesforce Account ID - available in the [CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in)
   under the `Edit` tab

## Billing

### Zuora contact change

When a customer wants to change the contact for current and future purchases.

> **Note:** *Billing doesn't have a vetting process, so we need to vet the
customer as far as possible before passing the request*

1. Verify that they are associated with the account / authorised to make the
   request, by checking the following:
   - if they are a contact in SFDC
   - if their domain name matches the company/previous contact
   - getting permission from the old contact
   - checking if they are the owner of the group (for a SaaS subscription)
   - checking if they have access to the instance (via a screenshot)
   - checking if they have access to the account by asking for an invoice
1. Use the [`Support::L&R::Zuora Contact Change`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=360072090060) macro to transfer the ticket to AR to
   update the bill to and sold to contact in Zuora

Support will still generate a manual license if new contact wants an updated
license. Zuora update is primarily effective for future purchases.

NOTE: The `Sold to` contact in Zuora usually receives the license, renewal reminders and comms about changes to the subscription (e.g renewal success/fail). The `Bill to` contact in Zuora will receive invoices as well as renewal reminders.

### Billing processes to know about

#### Zuora entity change

When billing processes an [entity change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/wikis/Process-for-change-of-entity),
billing creates a second Zuora account for the customer, with a different entity
than the original.

To identify entity changes, check the `Renewal subscription` field in a Zuora subscription.
The original (and now cancelled) subscription will point at a `Renewal subscription` that can be used to search for the new Zuora account.

##### Effect on Self-Managed subscriptions

When an entity change happens at renewal, it can impact how licenses are
generated. If you are troubleshooting a license issue, check Zuora to see if
there are 2 accounts with different entities to confirm if an entity change took
place.

The issue that we will see more often is the renewal license not generated with
previous users or trueups. In the event of the license being impacted by the
entity change, we can assist with a manual license.

##### Effect on SaaS subscriptions

As part of the [entity change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/wikis/Process-for-change-of-entity) process,
the Billing team sets the new Zuora account to `silent` when creating the relevant quote, opportunity, and subscription from the previous account.

The `silent` account setting results in no **Order** being created in [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
You can confirm that a Zuora account is `silent` by checking **Billing and Payment Info** -> **Communication Profile**.

**NOTE:** A subscription in the Customers Portal account may be visible but it would be impossible to link it to a group because of lack of an Order entry.

These situations are handled by following the steps in the [Billing Entity Change: Associate Subscription](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Billing%20Entity%20Change%3A%20Associate%20Subscription.md)
issue template.

## Cancellations, Downgrades, and Refunds

### Cancellations

When a customer wishes to cancel their subscription and they are not interested
in waiting until the subscription expires.

1. Make sure that there aren't any other types of queries that would need the
   Support team's attention
1. Use the [`General::Accounts Receivable`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360038646513) macro to transfer the ticket to AR to
   process the cancellation. They will reply to the customer once done and issue
   a refund if applicable.

### Downgrades

There is currently [no ability to downgrade a subscription from a self-service perspective](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/368).

Plan downgrades should only be done at renewal. However, if the customer purchased the wrong plan as a new subscription, send
the request to the AR team by selecting the `Accounts Receivable` macro and ask that the incorrect purchase be cancelled so that a new subscription can be purchased on the Premium plan. 

If a SaaS Ulimtate customer would like to renew for a Premium plan, advise them to purchase a Premium subscription and link their group to the new subscription. Ensure that they have set their Ulitmate subscription to expire/cancel on the end date.

If a Self-managed Ultimate customer would like to renew for a Premium plan, refer them to Sales for assistance.

### Refunds

GitLab provides subscriptions on an annual basis which are not eligible for termination / refund for a customer's convenience. When a refund request is made, our billing team uses [this internal guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/wikis/Refund-Approvals-Sales-Assisted-&-Web-Direct) (GitLab internal) to determine if a refund is appropriate.

1. Determine the reason that the customer is cancelling and requesting a refund.
1. Let the customer know that the billing team will advise whether a refund is possible and process the request if appropriate.
1. Make sure that there aren't any other types of queries that would need the
   Support team's attention
1. Use the [`General::Accounts Receivable`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360038646513) macro to transfer the ticket to AR to advise and process if relevant. They will reply to the customer once done.

Note: we cannot do partial refunds, so when a refund is requested, the whole
subscription will have to be cancelled and refunded. See [Renewal reversal](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/billing_contact_change_payments.html#renewal-reversal) for accidental renewal scenarios.

## Invoice

### Request copy of invoice

Check first if the invoice is available in [CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).

* If yes: walk the customer through locating the invoices under Payment History for future self-service ability.
* If no: Use the [`General::Accounts Receivable`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360038646513) macro to transfer the ticket to AR to
  process the request. They will reply to the customer once done.

### Invoice modification

When a customer wishes to modify their invoice for tax or administration purposes.

1. Verify that the invoice exists in the system
1. Make sure that there aren't any other types of queries that would need the
   Support team's attention
1. Use the [`General::Accounts Receivable`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360038646513) macro to transfer the ticket to AR to
   process the request. They will reply to the customer once done.

## Payments

### Requests to make a payment/payment failed

Use the [`General::Accounts Receivable`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360038646513) macro to transfer the ticket to AR to
process the request. They will reply to the customer once done.

### Credit card removal

When a customer wishes to remove their credit card from their CustomersDot
account.

1. Make sure that there aren't any other types of queries that would need the
   Support team's attention.
1. Use the [`General::Accounts Receivable`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360038646513) macro to transfer the ticket to AR to
   process the request. They will reply to the customer once done.


### Renewal reversal

When a customer has accidentally renewed twice or mistakenly.

1. Determine the reason that the renewal has to be reversed
1. Use the [`General::Accounts Receivable`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360038646513) macro to transfer the ticket to AR,
   they will reverse the renewal so that the subscription is in the same state
   as before the renewal and refund the renewal if applicable

### Requests for split payments

When a customer has a payment limit on their card, preventing a single payment for the full amount of their purchase, Billing is able to charge the card in "batches".

1. Get information on the limit and the total cost of the purchase the customer wishes to make.
1. Use the [`General::Accounts Receivable`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360038646513) macro to transfer the ticket to AR to
   process the request. They will reply to the customer once done.

Note that in some cases, the total amount is too large to charge in 2 batches and Billing might request that a sales-assisted order is done instead. If you're unsure whether this would be the case, you can tag [at]Billing-ops in Chatter on the Account or Opportunity in SFDC to double-check with them.
