## General workflow

1. Respond to the customer on Zendesk:
   1. Assign the ticket to yourself.
   1. Select the appropriate specific workflow to follow (see below).
   1. Check the `Escalated to sales` box.
   1. Set the ticket status to `Pending`.
1. Leave a message for the Salesforce `Account Owner` on Chatter with the
   relevant details.
   * Consider adding the following note in the Chatter message:
     > Please note that according to the new "Working with Sales workflow" (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_with_sales.html) we expect a reply from you on this chatter within 24 hours stating when/if you will contact the customer.
   * Share the link to the Chatter message in an internal note on the ticket.
     * Note that you can only link to the original Chatter message, not to any of its comments.
   * You may want to check the account owner's Slack status to see if they're
     currently taking time off work.
   * If reaching out to the account owner on Slack (always on `#support_sales_escalation`
     and always *as a courtesy*), link them the Chatter message and ask them to
     respond there.
   * Note: Support should be able to rely on the Salesforce `Account Owner`
     field to determine who is responsible for the account. If that is incorrect,
     escalate it immediately (see point `3(i)`).
1. Escalation procedure:
   1. If the Salesforce `Account Owner` is unable/unwilling to assist
      1. Mention the account owner's direct manager in a Chatter comment.
      * Examples of being unable/unwilling to assist:
        * Account owner no longer works at GitLab.
        * Account owner says the account is not theirs any more.
        * Account owner says they have no time to help.
   1. If the Salesforce `Account Owner` is not a person
      1. Find the person in charge of the [sales segment](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#segmentation)
        and [sales territory](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/territories/#territories)
        and mention them in a Chatter comment.
   1. If anyone you reach out to does not respond within 24 hours:
      1. Mention the person's direct manager in a Chatter comment.
         * Suggested message text:
           > Following the new "Working with Sales workflow" (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_with_sales.html) I'm escalating this, as we haven't heard from <account owner\> within the agreed upon time.
         * From VP level onwards, mention them in a Slack message in
           `#support_sales_escalation` in addition to a Chatter comment.
           * Suggested message text in Chatter:
             > Following the new "Working with Sales workflow" (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_with_sales.html) I'm escalating this, as we haven't heard from <account owner\> nor <account owner's manager\> within the agreed upon time.
           * Suggested message text in Slack:
             > Following the new "Working with Sales workflow" I'm escalating support ticket https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/<ticket number\> as we haven't heard from <account owner\> nor <account owner's manager\> within the agreed upon time.
      1. Repeat as necessary every 24 hours and go one step up the reporting
         line, going all the way up to CEO if necessary.
   * It is helpful to refer to the [company organization chart](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/org-chart/)
     to see who to escalate to.
1. When someone from sales says they'll be in touch with the customer:
   1. Post an update to the ticket, mentioning:
      * The name of the person who will be in touch.
      * Tell the customer to let us know if they haven't heard back within 2
        business days.
      * Inform the customer that the ticket will auto-close after 7 days without
        a response from them.
      * Set the ticket status to `Pending`.


_(Pro tip: create a personal ticket view where "Escalated to Sales" = checked, to pull these out into their own queue)_

## Specific workflows to pass to Sales
