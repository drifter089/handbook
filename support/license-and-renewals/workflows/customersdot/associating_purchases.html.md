Sometimes a customer may ask that a colleague be given the ability to manage a
subscription. This can be accomplished provided they also have a CustomersDot
account.

**Add subscription management contact workflow**

Before we add subscription management contact, we need **one** of the following, once the above requirements have been met:

1. Approval from the existing contact
1. Prior subscription contract
1. Recent invoice (last 12 months)
1. Copy of last loaded license (Self-Managed only)

There is a macro that asks for this information. You can use [Change CustomerDotContact](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/admin/macros/360028045239) Be sure to copy the existing CustomersDot contact on the reply.

Once we have received one of the above, we can proceed to change/add a subscription management contact:

1. Locate the proper accounts in the CustomersDot and navigate to the `Edit` page
1. Copy the `Zuora ID` and `Salesforce Account ID` from the existing account to the new account and select `Save`

**Contact Change Workflow**

If the customer requests to change a contact, we should ask for the same subscription information as mentioned in the **Add subscription management contact workflow** above. Then confirm with the customer which of the cases below matches their goal:

| Cases                                                                                             | Response |      Actions  |  
|:---------------------------------------------------------|:----:|:-----|
| Transfer the subscription management to the `new email`                                           | Yes      | Copy the `Zuora ID` and `Salesforce Account ID` from the existing account to the new account on CustomerDot and select `Save`. |
| Stop managing subscription management on the `existing email`                                     | Yes      | Remove the `Zuora ID` and `Salesforce Account ID` from the existing account on CustomerDot and select `Save`. If `No`, do not update the existing account. |
| Also change future renewal related email to the `new email` or keep it to the `existing email`    | Yes      | Pass to Billing team. Use [Account Receivable](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/admin/macros/360038646513) macro in Zendesk and let them know that the contact on SFDC and Zuora needs to be updated to the `new email`. |
