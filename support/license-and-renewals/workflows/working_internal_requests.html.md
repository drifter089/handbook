### Servicing Internal Requests

Follow the same [General Workflow](/handbook/support/workflows/internal_requests.html#general-workflow) as dotcom for servicing L&R internal requests.

### L&R Internal Requests Hawk

> **NOTE** L&R Internal Requests are gradually moving to the L&R View in Zendesk. You can track the progress in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/support/-/epics/176)

There is a internal requests hawk role which rotates on a weekly basis which
serves as a temporary measure to make sure internal requests tagged with
the following labels receive the appropriate attention from Support:

* `Activate Trial Runners issue` - [Workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/saas/ci_minutes.html)
* `Associate Subscription Console Escalation::Customers` - Workflow to be documented
* `Console Escalation::Customers` - Workflow to be documented
* `Resend/Forward License Request` - [Workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/self-managed/creating_licenses.html#resend-forward-the-license)
* `GitLab.com Trial Extension Issue` - [Workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/saas/trials_and_plan_change.html#extending-trials)
* `License Issue` - [Workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/license_troubleshooting.html)
* `Plan Change Request` - [Workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/saas/trials_and_plan_change.html#plan-change-requests)
* `SaaS Subscription Issue` - [Workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/saas/associate_subscription_and_namespace.html)
* `Self Managed Trial Extension or Temporary License Issue` - [Workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/self-managed/trials.html)
* `Trial CI Minutes Issue` - Workflow instructions on template

When on this role, prioritize working on internal request issues over Zendesk tickets.
The general workflow guide and best practices are:

1. Review the list of [unassigned issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&assignee_id=None&not[label_name][]=Console%20Escalation%3A%3AGitLab.com&not[label_name][]=DEWR). 
    - For those with US Public Sector access please also check the [L&R view](https://gitlab-federal-support.zendesk.com/agent/filters/360196736931) in the US Federal Support Portal.
1. Pick an issue to work on/respond to and assign this to yourself.
1. If you have resolved the problem or attended to the request, close the issue and let the requestor know to re-open the issue if further assistance is required.
1. If you are awaiting manager approval or a reply from the requestor before moving the issue forward, add the appropriate labels (for example `Manager Approval::Awaiting` or `Status::Awaiting Confirmation`).
1. Repeat steps above until there are no longer any unassigned issues.
1. Check if there are any [assigned issues where responses have stalled](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&not[label_name][]=Console%20Escalation%3A%3AGitLab.com&not[label_name][]=DEWR&assignee_id=Any) and check with the assignee and requestor if follow up action needs to be taken.

You will continue to be responsible for any issues assigned to yourself even
after you're off the role, so be mindful about working sustainably. If you need
to, ask for others to help with unassigned issues -- the expectation is that
GitLab Support as a team should be responding timely to internal requests, not
you personally as the L&R Internal Requests Hawk.

You'll only be expected to work your usual work hours while doing this role. There
is a [PagerDuty schedule](https://gitlab.pagerduty.com/schedules#PQ6DB1G) set up
solely to facilitate tracking/swapping of shifts. It is in no way an indication of
actual hours of work.
