### How to manage plan/license related escalations

Any escalation during your [manager on-call shift](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/workflows/support_manager-on-call.html) can be evaluated using the following diagram.

### Edge cases

An edge case is any situation in which the process has been followed and the
system does not produce the expected results. Examples:

  - A customer is trying to [link their purchase to their account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/), but after following the process, the system produces an error.
  - The web page or system needed to complete the process is down.
  - The owner is not available.
