# Overview

Frequently we need to generate license files, the request for those can be originated in:

1. By a customer direct request in Zendesk
1. As part of an internal request

In both cases the license can be attached to the issue or ticket where the request was made, however a change to this policy will come in effect soom that will modify how we deliver support generated license files.
