## Overview

When customers purchase or renew a license (self-managed) or subscription
(GitLab.com), they sometimes run into problems applying or making use of their
purchase. License & Renewals (L&R) comprises efforts to resolve these problems.

L&R work generally involves collaborating with customers and other GitLab teams,
as well as checking internal GitLab systems and data validation. Some examples:

* General license queries from a user.
* Troubleshooting license upload errors and subscription association issues.
* Assisting Sales team members with requests related to licensing and
  subscriptions.

In July 2020, [a decision was made](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/96#note_384760742)
for L&R work to be handled by Support for the foreseeable future. The reasons
are:

1. Sales should not have access to generate [paid](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/internal-audit/internal-audit/-/issues/210)
   or [trial](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/internal-audit/internal-audit/-/issues/212)
   licenses for SOX compliance purposes.
1. [Business-critical priorities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/96#note_384808050)
   mean that the [Fulfillment product section](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#fulfillment-section)
   will not have sufficient capacity to address and resolve major pain points
   within the next 12 months.
1. The effort to stand up an entirely new team would be considerable; Support
   was already doing this work and was in a position to quickly scale up to meet
   customer needs.

Support is currently figuring out how best to meet customer needs around L&R
while not creating a separate team to do the work. The support engineering
managers currently actively involved are:

* Shaun McCann (Overall DRI)
* Ronnie Alfaro
* Wei-Meng Lee

## Getting started

The best way to get a guided start to L&R work is by working through the
[L&R Support training module](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/License%20and%20Renewals.md).

### What you'll be working on

* The [License & Renewals ticket queue](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/filters/360038103700) in Zendesk.
* The [Internal Requests issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/-/issues) on GitLab.com.
  See also the [working internal requests workflow page](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_internal_requests.html).
* Creating and/or updating [marketing pages](#marketing-pages),
  [product documentation](#product-documentation) and the
  [GitLab Handbook](#handbook-pages) and [workflows](#workflows) around
  L&R-related topics.
* Helping the Product group understand and prioritize product issues,
  specifically those in the
  [Fulfillment section backlog](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Afulfillment).

### Systems you'll need access to

To be effective with L&R work, you'll need access to systems and tools which you
might not otherwise encounter working other Support problem types. This list
supplements the baseline entitlements for the Support Engineer job family.

#### Salesforce
{:.no_toc}

A Salesforce.com (SFDC) account makes collaboration with Sales team members more
efficient, primarily because you'll be able to receive notifications when you're
tagged in a Chatter message (see the [working with Sales workflow](/handbook/support/licence-and-renewals/workflows/working_with_sales.html)).

When creating an individual/bulk access request, use the following information:

* System name:
  * If you are a US citizen:
    > SalesForce, Role: Executive - No View All, Profile: Read Only GitLab,
    > with US public sector record visibility
  * If you are not a US citizen:
    > SalesForce, Role: Executive - No View All, Profile: Read Only GitLab
* Justification for this access:
  > Support Engineers need their own Salesforce accounts to better collaborate
  > with Sales team members as they work on customer licensing issues. For more
  > information, see https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/index.html#salesforce

#### Zuora
{:.no_toc}

Zuora is considered the [single source of truth](/handbook/handbook-usage/#single-source-of-truth)
or [system of record](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#system-of-record)
for many L&R-related items, such as product SKUs, subscriptions and invoices
(see the [Transition to Zuora as the SSOT issue](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4664)
for more information).

Having access to Zuora will help with troubleshooting in situations where a
customer's CustomersDot and Salesforce records present conflicting or confusing
information.

When creating an individual/bulk access request, use the following information:

* System name:
  > Zuora READ-ONLY access
* Justification for this access:
  > Support Engineers need read-only Zuora access to troubleshoot License and
  > Renewal customer issues and support requests. For more information, see
  > https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/index.html#zuora

### Workflows

* [License & renewals workflows](workflows/index.html)
* [Internal policies and procedures wiki](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/license-and-renewals/-/wikis/home)

### Teams you'll be working with

#### Product
{:.no_toc}

As you work through the queue and on issues, if you spot something in the
[Fulfillment backlog](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Afulfillment)
that would makes things better for customers and Support, please donâ€™t forget to
label it with `Support Priority` - this helps the product team in prioritizing
for the next milestone.

##### Fulfillment stage
{:.no_toc}

The [Fulfillment](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/fulfillment/) Stage manages
Purchasing and Provisioning, CustomersDot Usage, and Subscription Management.
These teams own responsibilities that align with the types of requests we
generally see in the L&R queue.

`#s_fulfillment` channel in Slack

##### Growth stage
{:.no_toc}

When we look at the product [Growth](/handbook/product/categories/#growth-stage)
stage, we can see that the team owns responsibilities that align with some of
the types of requests we generally see in the L&R queue, in particular the
`Conversion` group.

- Activation Group: [New Group Namespace Verify Stage Adoption Rate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#new-group-namespace-verify-stage-adoption-rate)
- Adoption Group: [New Group Namespace Create Stage Adoption Rate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#new-group-namespace-create-stage-adoption-rate)
- Expansion Group: [New Group Namespace with at least two users added](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#new-group-namespace-with-at-least-two-users-added)
- Conversion Group:[New Group Namespace Trial to Paid Conversion Rate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#new-group-namespace-trial-to-paid-conversion-rate)

## What is **not in the scope** of L&R work in Support?

The L&R queue should not be used for the following:

* Billing related matters, such as payments, invoice generation, refunds, etc.
* Product related questions
* [New business requests](https://about.gitlab.com/sales/)
* Requests related to the
  [education program](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/education/)
* Requests related to the
  [open source program](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/join/)
