## Introduction

When customers purchase or renew a license (self-managed) or subscription
(GitLab.com), they sometimes run into problems applying or making use of their
purchase. License & Renewals (L&R) comprises efforts to resolve these problems.

L&R work generally involves collaborating with customers and other GitLab teams,
as well as checking internal GitLab systems and data validation.

In July 2020, [a decision was made](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/96#note_384760742)
for L&R work to be handled by Support for the foreseeable future. The reasons
are:

1. Sales should not have access to generate [paid](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/internal-audit/internal-audit/-/issues/210)
   or [trial](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/internal-audit/internal-audit/-/issues/212)
   licenses for SOX compliance purposes.
1. [Business-critical priorities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/96#note_384808050)
   mean that the [Fulfillment product section](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-categories/#fulfillment-section)
   will not have sufficient capacity to address and resolve major pain points
   within the next 12 months.
1. The effort to stand up an entirely new team would be considerable; Support
   was already doing this work and was in a position to quickly scale up to meet
   customer needs.

Support is currently figuring out how best to meet customer needs around L&R
while not creating a separate team to do the work. The support engineering
managers currently actively involved are:

* Shaun McCann (Overall DRI)
* Ronnie Alfaro
* Wei-Meng Lee
