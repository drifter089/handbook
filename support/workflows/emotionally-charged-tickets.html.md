## Introduction

When customers start putting negative emotions into ticket communications, it
can be very difficult to figure out what to do. Our goal remains the same: to
provide a thorough resolution to the customer's problem or answer to their
question. But now we have the added challenge of responding in ways that will
reduce the emotional presence so that we may resume working toward the goal.
Our intention here is to provide tools and tips for doing just that.

## Be Proactive - Prevent the Problem

Often, emotions come in to a ticket as a direct result of our previous actions
or inaction on the ticket or even on a previous ticket. We might answer the
wrong question. We might set an incorrect expectation, or not set an expectation
at all. We might be too slow. We might ask for information they've already
provided. We might contradict what one or more of our colleagues said in an
earlier response. And the list goes on... So let's consider a few ways that we
might avoid those problems and hopefully keep the customer happy with our
support delivery:

### 1. Confirm the Request
As the first action on a ticket, verify that you understand the customer's
request. Use your own words to summarize it in your response. Consider also
verifying the business impact. Through this action, you will avoid the problem
of answering the wrong question or working on the wrong problem.

### 2. Connect the Past, Present and Future
At the beginning of each interaction (which could be a quick series of back-
and-forth messages, for example) with the customer, be sure to indicate what's
happened since the last interaction, what the current state is, what the next
actions are, who will take them, and why those actions should be taken. When you
take this step you're ensurity a common understanding of the situation and the
plan; you're setting expectations.

### 3. Find the Yes
When we won't be able to do exactly what the customer wants, instead of just
saying "no," find good alternatives and present those.

### 4. Communicate Thoroughly
Read every message from the customer thoroughly, twice if it helps, and be
sure that in your reply you respond to everything they presented to you.
Acknowledge their thoughts, concerns, priorities, timelines, etc. Answer each
of their questions **or** tell them you are researching the questions if you
don't yet have an answer. When you do these things, you let the customer know
that you are paying attention, that you care about them, and that you truly
intend to help. This goes a long, long way toward keeping a customer happy.

### 5. Don't Be Silent
When you're researching a customer's problem, keep them informed regularly.
They will be thrilled to know that you're working on their behalf to find the
best answer. So set an expectation with them at each communication of when
you'll update them again - keep the intervals short - and give them updates on
your progress instead of leaving them in silence until you find your final answer.

### 6. Know the Ticket
If you're going to work on a ticket that isn't assigned to you, or that's
had other people involved, be sure you know the whole history of the ticket
before you communicate with the customer. This allows you to avoid the mistakes
of repeating requests and of contradicting previous instructions.

## Act Quickly

Despite our best efforts to keep the customer happy from start to finish, there
will still be plenty of times when a customer will express negative emotions in
a ticket.
At the first sign of frustration or other negative emotions from a customer, schedule a Zoom meeting with them. Even if all you do on the Zoom meeting is to review the situation, gain further clarity into their needs, the business impact, etc., it's well worth doing. This is a great opportunity to explain what you're thinking and the next steps you want to take in getting closer to resolution for them. And you can probably do it in only 15 - 30 minutes.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

1. Get other GitLab team members involved to help

   You're never alone at GitLab. Ask colleagues, managers, team members in
   other departments whenever you need help, whether with the technical
   aspects of the situation or the nontechnical ones.

1. Assume good intent

   Almost always the customer just wants to solve a problem. So try focusing
   on what they need and what you can do by stating to yourself:

   1. “This customer wants me to [action words used by the customer].”
   1. “I can help them feel good about our company by [implied or emotional
      need of the customer.]”
1. Try to view things from the customer's perspective
   Start by acknowledging what they've said and validating their problem.
1. Show respect
Sympathize with the customer.
Read carefully, pay attention to detail.
Remember there is a human being on the other end.
Ask yourself - If I were in their situation, how would I want to be replied to?
Get other GitLab team members involved.
Understand and talk in terms of the other person's interest.
Make sure the customer knows we value their feedback.
Make it clear that you sincerely want to help them succeed.
Validate the facts.
If you're feeling emotional or don't feel that you can provide the best customer experience, please escalate to your manager.

Don't:

Take it personally.
Empathize to the point of pain.
Keep it a secret - tell your manager.
Blame others
Argue
Assume


2. Complete these sentences:
   

3. Take the actions you’ve identified.

4. In your reply, use the exact same words as the customer to describe what you’ve done.
    If they wrote “delete”, write “delete”. 
    (If you can’t do exactly what they’ve asked you to do,
    say so - and what you’ve done instead.)

Reply Examples:
"I hear your frustration about..." - don't label their emotion, as this statement does. Say something more like "I understand that you need this problem solved quickly," or "I know this situation is frustrating right now."
"This inconvenience is disrupting your workflow, and I want to help fix it" - don't use "inconvenience," it makes a problem sound trivial. Call it a problem: "I know this problem is disrupting your business, and I will work with you to get it resolved as quickly as possible."
"We/I value your feedback and appreciate your time while we work through..."
"You bring up a good point. I see why this is important, and I'd like to help."
