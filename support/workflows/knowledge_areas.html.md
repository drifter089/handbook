### Overview

The following pages provide a reference of Support team members who
feel that they are knowledgeable and willing to assist with tickets in a
particular area.

- [Skills by Person](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-person.html)
- [Skills by Subject](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-subject.html)

Unlike the [team page](/company/team/), team members listed here may or may not
be [an expert](/company/team/structure/#expert) as defined in the Handbook. For example, they may be
[working on a module](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates)
but have not completed it. Additionally, some areas may not currently have a module, or the
knowledge area is very specific, such as "GitLab.com SSO".

### When to Use

Team members should make use of existing resources before making use of this
list: docs, ZenDesk, Slack (support, stage/group specific channels, questions).

If no response is forthcoming or you need to find someone to assist, you can
consider pinging team members listed
[here](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-person.html).

When pinging a team member, please consider the
[Support Engineer Areas of Focus](/handbook/support/support-engineer-responsibilities.html#support-engineer-areas-of-focus)
as some team members may or may not have access to what is being inquired about.
You can see each what a team member's focus is via
[Areas of Focus](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/areas-of-focus.html).

Please remember to post in the appropriate Slack channel (such as #kubernetes)
and/or check the [team page](/company/team/) for non-support team members who
can help as well.

Please use
[Skills by Person](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-person.html)
or
[Skills by Subject](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team/skills-by-subject.html)
for assistance in locating someone within the Support Team.
