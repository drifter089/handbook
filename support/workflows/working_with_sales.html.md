### Overview of Sales

Account Managers are assigned accounts based on market segment, which is determined by region and size.

Noting size is defined by:

1. Large (2000+ total employees)
1. MidMarket (100-1,999 total employees)
1. Small business (0-99 total employees).

When we pass to sales, we can find the relevant person by looking at the [sales territories](/handbook/sales/territories/).

### Find the Account Manager in Salesforce (SFDC)

- **Account exists, Sales assigned**: Identify if the company is in SFDC; look up the email domain in SFDC global search. Note the `Type` field in the SFDC account record (Customer vs. Prospect). If prospect account is found, and `Account Owner` contains a sales rep, pass the ticket to the Account Owner listed using the [Pass to Sales ZD macro](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/admin/macros/360025924680).
- **Account exists, Sales not assigned**: If the account is in SFDC, but there is no Account Owner listed, use the `Sales Segment` (Large, MM, Small) and Billing Address to determine which salesperson the request should be passed using the [Pass to Sales ZD macro](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/admin/macros/360025924680) based on [Sales territories](/handbook/sales/territories/).
- **Account does not exist**: If the account is not in SFDC, respond to ticket with the [New Sales Quote ZD macro](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/admin/macros/360026025019).
