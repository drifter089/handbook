## Introduction

This page presents the workflows to be used in Support Engineering to schedule,
prepare for, manage and follow-up on customer calls.

## Emotional Headwinds

We [hire smart humans to provide smart support](/handbook/support/workflows/how-to-respond-to-tickets.html#smart-humans-provide-smart-support). Humans have _feelings_. It is important to recognize that there are emotional headwinds that can make it harder to schedule or be in calls. During a call you're putting yourself into a situation where you have to manage:
 - your own feelings
 - the customer's experience
 - the customer's feelings
 - technical troubleshooting
 - time, efficiency and your own energy

Calls can be a vulnerable experience that hit on core human fears:
 - **Being wrong** - providing incorrect information or poor guidance
 - **Being in conflict / tension** - having to work with customers in heightened emotional states 
 - **Being rejected** - having a customer judge you as insufficient, incompetent or inadequate to meet the challenge 
 - **Being drained** - spending so much energy on preparing, running and following-up on a call you don't have energy to contribute elsewhere
 - **Being alone** - having no support or guidance as you work through a challenging situation
 - **Being trapped** - not being able to escape a tense or challenging situation
 - **Missing out** - operating from an area of weakness when there are opportunities to contribute your strengths 

If you're feeling one of the results of one of these headwinds it can be easy to rationalize why you shouldn't move the ticket to a call. The feelings you're feeling though shouldn't be ignored. Before judging whether or not to move to a call: 

1. **Stop** and experience what you're feeling without judgement.
1. **Be curious about your feelings**: is any of your resistance related to a core fear?
1. **Try and separate out the facts of the case**: form ["steel man" arguments](/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent) for resolution time, SSAT or customer experience to round things out.
1. **Empathize** with the customer and try and see the case from their perspective.
1. **Talk with a peer or manager** to give yourself a second / more objective opinion.

## When should a ticket go to a call?

## Types of calls

### Discovery calls

Sometimes a one hour call doesn't seem like the best step to take forward, and
may not be the best use of our time. This is where the Discovery Call comes in.

A Discovery call is a short 15 minute call with the sole purpose of learning
enough to start troubleshooting asynchronously again. These calls are also
great at helping ease a customer who is getting frustrated not being able to
_show_ us the problem.

If you feel that you're close to a resolution or need more time to collect info,
then it's at your discretion to continue the call or not.

Create a Calendly event in your account labeled `Support - Discovery Call with <your name>`
and send a one-time link to this event when you find that a Discovery call
would be useful.

### Upgrade Assistance

Premium Support customers may request a call as a part of upgrade assistance. Read more about this in the dedicated [Upgrade Assistance workflow](/handbook/support/workflows/upgrade-assistance.html).


### Unscheduled calls

While working with customers you should always be prepared to host a quick call
with them. It's easier to get all the information you might need on a short (5 -
20 minutes) call than in a long series of back-and-forth emails. If anything
similar to the following situations is true, suggest a Zoom call:

*  the initial problem statement is very unclear
*  you aren't getting what you need from the customer after one or two email
   requests
*  you aren't making good progress toward resolution
*  you sense the customer is getting frustrated or upset

If you feel too inexperienced to handle a call, ask someone more experienced to
lead it while you shadow. After shadowing, it is still your responsibility
to handle the ticket as long as it is assigned to you.

If the problem is urgent you can simply send the customer a Zoom link and jump on immediately. For less urgent
calls, you may send the customer a Calendly link so that they can schedule a convenient time in their time zone.
The link you send may be a link to your personal calendar or to the Team Calendly event, depending on the circumstances,
but in every case you should send a
[single-use Calendly link](/handbook/support/workflows/calendly.html#generating-a-single-use-calendly-link),
to ensure proper processes are followed for scheduling calls.

## Taking Calls

Under development in MR: [www-gitlab-com!117169](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/117169/diffs)

### Scheduling the call

When you know a ticket is ready for a call, start by determining who will lead
the call:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A{Does the customer want to<BR>meet during my work hours?}
    A --> |Yes| B{Am I comfortable leading the call?}
    A --> |No| C(Find someone in the appropriate<BR>region of your group who is<BR>willing to take the ticket,<BR>preferably but not necessarily<BR>with the needed expertise.<BR>The new SE can pair with another<BR>person in their region if necessary.)
    B --> |Yes| D("Proceed to<BR>#quot;Providing the call link#quot;")
    B --> |No| E(Pair with an SE who has the right expertise)
    C --> H("(sync or async)" Review the ticket with<BR>the new SE before handing it over.)
    E --> F{Look for an SE in your group}
    F --> |Found one!| D
    F --> |Didn't find one| G(Find an SE from the<BR>rest of Global Support.<BR>Get manager help if needed.)
    G --> D
```

### Providing the call link

Start by using the
[`General::Invite customer call`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360013199280)
macro in Zendesk. Be sure to change `PERSONAL_CALENDLY_LINK` to be your own personal
Calendly link.

When sending a customer a call link:

* Always use [single-use Calendly link](/handbook/support/workflows/calendly.html#generating-a-single-use-calendly-link)
  to invite customers to a call so that we can avoid ghost calls.
* Ensure the [event title](https://calendly.com/event_types)
  [includes the word `Support`](/handbook/support/workflows/calendly.html#support-calls-in-the-team-calendar)
  (case insensitive). This is necessary for the event to appear in the
  `GitLab Support` Calendar.
* Make sure your calendly event includes a required Invitee Question asking
  for the Zendesk ticket number.
* If you know your availability is limited, or you need additional backup,
  check with another SE to see if they might also be available to take the call.

### Pre-call email

Please consider sending a pre-call email. This helps set expectations to the call regarding goals, duration, and
the people required to be on the call for effective troubleshooting. You can use the [`Support::Self-Managed::Pre customer call`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360086318253) macro in Zendesk
for that, please modify it as you see fit.

### Tips to keep calls within the scheduled time:

* Set expectations (again) at the start of the call:
   1. Call duration will be X
   1. 5-15 minutes before the end time, call wrap up will happen (below)
   1. Will need access to applicable systems
* At wrap-up time: 
   1. Start to wind down the call
* Stop the call and review progress and status (solved, not solved more info needed)
   1. Solvable in the next few minutes
   1. Need to research/schedule additional call
* Review
   1. Summary of what was learned
   1. Next steps for GitLab Support Engineer
   1. Next steps for user
   1. Next call recommendations (timing/goals/expectations)

## Tips for making calls successful

### Customer No Shows

There are many reasons that a customer may not be able to join a call. If a customer doesn't join the call and you've waited for over *10 minutes*, end the call, update the ticket and resend your Calendly link to schedule a new call. Your response on the ticket should just state that you're sorry you didn't get a chance to meet and would they please use the link to schedule a new call.

## Post-call

Under development in MR: [www-gitlab-com!117225](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/117225/diffs)

### Call summary

**Immediately** following your call you should construct the call summary in
the Zendesk ticket using the macro
[`Support::Self-Managed::Post Customer Call`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360028010274).
The call summary is important for confirming with the customer what was said
and done during the call, and documenting for them and for us the agreed-upon
action plan. And as with all ticket documentation, it is a source of
valuable information for support engineers looking for resolution guidance from
tickets similar to their own.

Why should the summary be written immediately? First, your ability to remember
the details of the call will fade quickly, especially if the call was at the end
of your day. Second, follow-up action may be required from others, and they
will only be able to act appropriately if they have the call summary available.

### WebEx

For some customers, only Cisco systems are allowed and in those cases, WebEx will be the best tool for calls. To start a call/session, use the `GitLab Support` WebEx account. Go to our [WebEx Portal](https://gitlabmeetings.webex.com), click on the login button on the top right and use the credentials found in the Support Vault on 1Password.

![WebEx Login](/images/support/web-ex-login.png)

Once logged in, click the `Enter Room` button to start the WebEx meeting and send the following link to the customer and ask them to join the call.

```
https://gitlabmeetings.webex.com/meet/gitlabsupport
```

![WebEx Room](/images/support/web-ex-room.png)

> Note: Make sure you lock the meeting so that you (as the presenter) have to allow people in. Otherwise others may attempt to use the room.

WebEx allows you to see the customer's desktop and to control it on request. It also gives the customer the possibility to join via phone and us the possibility to use our computer audio connection.

### If a customer wants to record a support call

Frequently during screenshare sessions plaintext secrets or other sensitive information can be displayed. To ensure sure that any recordings that inadvertantly contain this information stay within customer's security boundary, you should ask that customers initiate and store any recordings.

If a customer wishes to record the session, then transfer the ownership of the call to the customer or ask the customer to invite you to a new call to make sure recording is done by the customer.

If you're not comfortable having the call recorded, please involve your manager in the discussion with the customer.
