## Use case

Tickets often come in without an associated organization, which means that no SLA is applied.

Potential reasons this might occur:

1. It's the first time user has submitted a ticket.
1. The user is writing from a domain name that doesn't match what we have in ZD
  (for example, using a personal email address for a work-related issue).
1. The user or organization has a no subscription or a trial subscription.

### Determining if this workflow applies

This workflow applies if ZD displays `No organization` for a ticket.

## Identifying customers and users

Tickets can be created by different types of users.
Check whether a requester matches a type in the following order:

1. **[Customer](#identifying-customers)** - Has a paid current subscription for GitLab SaaS and/or self managed.
  - Customers receive SLA on their tickets as described in the [Standard and Priority Support](/support/#standard-support) section.
1. **[Prospect](#identifying-and-marking-prospects)** - Organization trialing GitLab that is sales assisted, also often referred to as a POC (proof of concept).
  - Prospects do not receive SLA unless sales has [manually marked them as a priority prospect](/handbook/support/internal-support/#trials-and-prospect-support).
1. **[Trial](#identifying-and-marking-trials)** - User or organization that has taken out a trial, typically using the free trial form.
  - Often, users identify themselves as `Ultimate` based on their trial plan, but **Trial** users do not get support as mentioned on the [Free trial page](/free-trial/).
1. **[Free User](#identifying-free-users)** - User of GitLab (SaaS or self managed) who has not purchased any type of paid subscription plan, and is not a Prospect.

### Identifying customers

If a requester has identified themselves as a paid customer,
you can tie the ZenDesk organization to the user if the user meets one of the following:

1. In Salesforce (SFDC), the email is listed as a contact for an organization.
1. Meets [proof of entitlement](/support/#proving-your-support-entitlement), meaning:
  - For self-managed, the user has provided the required license information.
  - For GitLab.com, user is a member of paid group. Use the `GitLab User Lookup` app in the Zendesk sidebar to check the user's membership details.
1. Possibly, ask the TAM (Technical Account Manager) or Account Owner (also known as AM / Account Manager)
listed in SalesForce, in the `#account-management` slack channel,
to add the user under the contacts for that Salesforce Account. We have contact syncing available from SFDC to Zendesk.
While that's happening, please let the customer know you are reaching out to their TAM/AM to get them properly associated with the organization.

*Look up resource*: You can use the [customer account look up workflow](looking_up_customer_account_details.html)
to find the relevant subscription and organization name.

If the user has not met the above criteria:

- If it's unclear, you may need to ask the customer [to prove their entitlement](/support/#proving-your-support-entitlement) (for self-managed, macro: `Support::Self-Managed::Locating GitLab subscription`).
- If the customer has a subscription, but *not* for the product they're inquiring about,
let the customer know and consider them [a prospect](#identifying-and-marking-prospects).
- If after reviewing the "proof", they do not appear to be a customer, check the following sections on identifying and marking trials, prospects, and free users.

### Identifying and marking prospects

The user is a prospect:

- if SFDC Account Type is "Prospect".
- typically self-identified in ZD as "Sales Assisted Trial".

#### Priority prospect with SLA

When [sales has marked a prospect organization](/handbook/support/internal-support/#trials-and-prospect-support)
with `Manual Support Upgrade`:

- [Associate the org](#adding-a-customer-to-an-organization) synced from SFDC.
- SLA will be automatically applied based on the `priority_prospect` tag.

#### Other prospects

For all other prospects:

- add the `prospect` tag.

**Note:** It will be moved to the `Free user tickets` view without SLA,
so you should also respond with the appropriate `Free User` macro.

#### Organization incorrectly marked as a Prospect in SFDC

In SFDC, you may notice an organization has the Type set to `Prospect` but associated with a non Expired support level,
and the account in the CustomersDot shows that the org has a valid self-managed license or a GitLab.com subscription.
In this case, you may need to update the org in SFDC:

- Check if `Subscriptions` section in SFDC contains information about a valid subscription.
- Check if account in the CustomersDot contains information about the purchased subscription.
- Double click `Prospect` type, change it to `Customer` and click `Save`.
- After that, notify `@Sales-Support` by following the steps similar to the ones in [this section](sla_and_views.html#handling-customers-with-expired-licenses-and-updating-info-on-sfdc-side) to tag them.
- **IMPORTANT**: if you are not sure about the changes, ask `Sales-Support` to do it.
- As soon as the org has a valid `Customer` type, it will propagate to Zendesk.

### Identifying and marking trials

If you cannot find an account (organization) in SFDC, when searching by email, you should find:

- a *Lead*, where `Initial Source` mentions `Trial`,
- date is within the last 30 days.

Alternate ways to check:

- GitLab.com: [CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin) > `GitLab Groups` Tab >
an expiration date under the **Trials** column.
If needed, also check the
[internal-requests project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/issues)
for manual plan changes.
- Self-managed: [LicenseDot](http://license.gitlab.com) portal as per [customer info license lookup](looking_up_customer_account_details.html#within-licensegitlabcom).

If you identify a ticket as from a trial user,

- select `Self-provisioned trial` in the `SaaS Subscription` or `Self-Managed Subscription`field

**Note:**  A Zendesk trigger will automatically add a `trial` tag to the ticket and it will be moved to the `Free user tickets` view without SLA,
so you should also respond with the appropriate `Free User` macro.

### Identifying free users

If you cannot identify a user as a customer, prospect, or trial, [mark them as a free user](#marking-free-users).

## Associating an organization

### Finding the appropriate organization name

While often they match, the organization name a customer provides will not always match what's in ZD.

Since [the ZD organization information is synced from the SFDC Account](/handbook/support/support-ops/responsibilities.html#account---organization-sync-from-salesforce),
if you're unsure, [looking up the account in Salesforce](looking_up_customer_account_details.html#within-salesforce) for the org name.

You can search for organizations using the ZD search (see screenshow below).

![Selecting an organization in ZD](/images/handbook/support/zendesk_needs_org-finding-org.png)

### Adding a customer to an organization

Follow these steps after [identifying the user as a customer](#identifying-customers).

To associate a user with an organization:

1. Make sure the user exists in SFDC. If not, please ping their AM/TAM (via Chatter aka Salesforce Feed) to add the user in SFDC.
1. Click on the user's name in ZD ticket.
1. In the "Org" field type the organization name.
1. Select the appropriate organization.

![Adding a user to an existing organization](/images/handbook/support/zendesk_needs_org-add.png)
 

**Note**: If a customer raises a ticket to add some users in their organization, here are some things to take note of: 

- If the user exists in both SFDC and Zendesk, we can associate the user to the org. 
- If the user exists in SFDC but not in Zendesk, you can create the user in Zendesk if you desire or just inform the user that when they first submit a ticket in the Support Portal the Zapier process we have in place should auto-associate the user in the org.
- If the user does not exist in both SFDC and Zendesk,  we can ping their TAM/AM (via Chatter aka Salesforce Feed) and ask them to add the user in SFDC. Once the user is in SFDC, the Zapier process we have in place will also auto-associate the user to their org when they register or submit a ticket via the Support portal. 

### Removing a user from an organization

If you erroneously assigned a user to an incorrect organization, follow these steps to un-assign a user:

1. Click on the user's name in ZD ticket.
1. Click the "Org" field and type `-` instead of the org name.
1. Make sure that the user changes were saved - you will see a message like `<User Name> was successfully updated.`
1. Please remove the form related tags in case if form of the ticket needs to be changed from the ticket as well. For example, Subscription type or problem type tags would be different for SAAS or Self Managed form.

**Note**: If the organization automatically comes back after un-assigning it, it likely means that this org has `Domains` specified:
if an org has `domain.tld` in `Domains` list, any user with `@domain.tld` will be automatically added to this org. If it is the case, please contact `#support_operations` Slack channel to discuss and fix it.


## Marking free users

After [identifying a free user ticket](#identifying-free-users):

- Self-managed:
  1. Change the ticket to use the `Community` form if applicable.
  1. Change the `Self-Managed Subscription` to `Free customer`
  1. Reply using the `Free user` macro to explain they do not receive support.
- GitLab.com:
  1. Ensure the correct form (accounts or general).
  1. Change the `SaaS Subcription` to `Free user`.
  1. Select the appropriate `Problem Type`.
    - If you cannot choose an appropriate problem type, then check [if the user qualifies](/support/statement-of-support.html#support-for-free-plan-users).
  1. If the user does not qualify for support, use the appropriate `Free user` macro.

The ticket will be moved to the `Free user tickets` view.

For example:

- a user `username@domain.tld` submits a ticket to GitLab Support.
- you search by the requester's e-mail i.e. `username@domain.tld`, the e-mail
  specified in the field `Email associated with your subscription`, or using the
  customer's domain and you cannot find any related accounts in SFDC.
- you search for the same data in the CustomersDot and cannot find any accounts there.
- you view any groups the user is a member of and confirm that no subscriptions exist in the CustomersDot
- you view `GitLab User Lookup` app in the Zendesk sidebar and none of the groups are on a paid plan
- if an account exists in the CustomersDot, no subscriptions are shown and you see
  `Choose a plan that suits your needs` when using `Impersonate` functionality.

## Customer is using personal email

Sometimes the customer raise tickets with the personal email instead of
business email or the business email is not synced in Zendesk. After providing
[proof of entitlement](/support/#proving-your-support-entitlement), please use
the following cases for your ease:

- Customer used Subscription Email field in form to show associated email but used personal email for raising ticket:
  1. If `Subscription Email` helps in identifying the organization and that is not added in SFDC, use [this process to add them.](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/workflows/associating_needs_org_tickets_with_orgs.html#adding-a-customer-to-an-organization)
  1. Once added in SFDC, merge the personal email with associated email.
- Customer have both generic email and business email listed in SFDC but only one email is present in Zendesk:
  1. Merge the personal email with business email. (Contact Support Ops if you are unable to add secondary email).
  1. Inform the customer that you have added the personal email as secondary email.
- Customer raised ticket with business email but in middle of ticket responding with personal email:
  1. Merge the personal email with business email. (Contact Support Ops if you are unable to add secondary email).
  1. Inform the customer that you have added the personal email as secondary email.
- Customer raised a ticket with business email listed in SFDC but not in Zendesk:
  1. Our Zapier sync will link the customer with the correct organization if it is already listed in SFDC.

Note: Proof of entitlement strictly includes primary email address associated for SAAS and company provided email address for SM.
