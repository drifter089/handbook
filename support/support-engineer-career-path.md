## Support Engineer Career Path
The Support team follows the [Engineering Career Development](/handbook/engineering/career-development/) guidelines which offers an exciting track for [role promotions](/handbook/engineering/career-development/#support-department) in the Support Department. 

This page provides specific considerations and details to help you plan your path to promotion within Support. Use this as a guide to really consider where you would like to take your career, as well as to develop a career plan with your manager.

When you are ready to start building your path to promotion, review the tips on [creating and building a promotion doc](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#creating-a-promotion-or-compensation-change-document). Ask for manager guidance and feedback as necessary.

## Path to Promotion: Support Engineering Manager
Choosing to take the management path involves a holistic approach that goes well beyond a checklist of tasks and accomplishments. Becoming a good manager requires a set of people skills that not only embodies the [values of GitLab](/handbook/values/), but goes beyond any boundaries that may exist to successfully support and lead a team of diverse individuals.

### Considerations and Preparations
As you begin to track and document your promotion document for moving into a management role, use meaningful examples that highlight the following:
- You have the level of confidence needed to initiate change, address challenging situations, and make difficult decisions.
- You have the ability to show humility and accept pushback or failure.
- You have the ability to accept accountability in support of an individual, the team, our customers, and the business.
- You have the ability to influence positive change (improvements), starting at the individual level.
- You have the ability to build (not demand) trust and respect with team members ranging from peers to direct reports to team members and executives across the entire organization.

The following additional considerations can help you prepare and better understand what to expect, as you work to build your path towards becoming a Support Engineering Manager.
- Read about [what you can expect in a Support Engineering Manager role](/job-families/engineering/support-management/#what-you-can-expect-in-a-manager-support-engineering-role-at-gitlab).
- Read about the [Support Engineering Manager Responsibilities](/handbook/support/managers/manager-responsibilities.html).
- Read about why [candidates should apply for a Support Manager role](/job-families/engineering/support-management/#you-should-apply-if) to understand what GitLab looks for when hiring for this role.
- Read [Transitioning from Individual Contributor to Manager](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/engineers/training/ic-to-manager/).
- Read about [Individual Contribution vs. Management](/handbook/engineering/career-development/#individual-contribution-vs-management) and [Trying the Management Track](/handbook/engineering/career-development/#trying-the-management-track).
- Read about the [Interim Manager](/handbook/engineering/career-development/#interim-manager) role.
- Consider experiences beyond what you have accomplished at GitLab (previous job experiences or even personal accomplishments) as supportive examples for building your path to promotion for a management role.
