## Career Development in Support

Exploring your passions and interests is just as important as focusing on a plan of short and long-term goals needed for any career development plan. Taking that time to explore, prepare, learn, and self-reflect can help ensure that you remain on track with where you ultimately want to grow.

While it's important to understand the how (how do I accomplish my goal? how do I get promoted?) and the what (what do I want to do? what do I need to do to get there? what do I still need to learn?), understanding the *why* is what becomes your ultimate driving force.
  
Promotions within the Support Department are guided by the [Support Career Framework Matrix](handbook/engineering/career-development/matrix/engineering/support/), following [this track of role promotions](/handbook/engineering/career-development/#support-department). Consider the matrix (competency requirements) and promotion path as your expected baseline targets. Utilize the resources and recommendations in this document to explore your *why*, and to build your path to promotion with an extended view of what you can expect as you decide on your direction.

When you are ready to start building your path to promotion, review the tips on [creating and building a promotion doc](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#creating-a-promotion-or-compensation-change-document). Ask for manager guidance and feedback as necessary.

### General Recommendations (Applies to Any Promotion Path)
Familiarize yourself with what it means to plan your career path, and how leadership plays a role in your next step.

- Read about [Career Development at Gitlab](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/).
- Read about [Engineering Career Development at Gitlab](/handbook/engineering/career-development/).
- Watch [this video on the Critical Career Path Conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMz6QDURQOM&list=PLBzScQzZ83I8H8_0Qete6Bs5EcW3p0kZF&index=7).
- Read [leadership books](/handbook/leadership/#books) (strongly suggested).
- Watch this [Engineering IC Leadership - Handbook Learning Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXBwtaZ9edQ) to understand the difference between **IC leadership** and **Management**.

## Path to Promotion: Senior Support Engineering
A Senior-level Support engineer is a natural leader who has championed multiple areas of technical skillsets required to resolve both intermediate and complex customer issues. Senior engineers are direct mentors of Support Engineers, and extend their contributions to other areas, such as contributing to documentation, bug fixes, workflow improvements, or working as the next point of technical escalations.

### Considerations and Recommendations
Recommendations to explore this path:

- Read about the [Senior Support Engineer role criteria](/job-families/engineering/support-engineer/#senior-support-engineer).
- Read about the [Senior level competencies and framework requirements](/handbook/engineering/career-development/matrix/engineering/support/senior/).

Considerations when building your path:

- Schedule a coffee chat or AMA with a Senior Engineer to better understand what they do, and ask for advice on how to work towards this role.

## Path to Promotion: Staff Engineering
Choosing to move into a Staff-level role within the Support team involves an advanced level of technical skills that are often both broad and deep, in combination with leadership skills that help support and mentor other engineers. Staff Engineers lead by example, and often help to breakdown barriers between customers, Support, and other cross-functional teams by contributing to bug fixes, feature enhancements, or diving into deeper complex issues. 


### Considerations and Recommendations
Recommendations to explore this path:

- Read about [what staff level means at GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/02/18/staff-level-engineering-at-gitlab/).
- Read about the [Staff Support Engineer role criteria](/job-families/engineering/support-engineer/#staff-support-engineer).
- Read about the [Staff level competencies and framework requirements](/handbook/engineering/career-development/matrix/engineering/staff/).
- Watch [this discussion about becoming a Staff engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN4LyA4nDg0).

Considerations when building your path:

- Schedule a coffee chat or AMA with a Staff Engineer to better understand what they do, ask for advice, and seek to dive into why they went this direction or why they feel they were promoted to Staff.

## Path to Promotion: Support Engineering Manager
Choosing to take the management path involves a holistic approach that goes well beyond a checklist of tasks and accomplishments. Becoming a good manager requires a set of people skills that not only embodies the [values of GitLab](/handbook/values/), but goes beyond boundaries as needed to successfully support and lead a team of diverse individuals. Maintaining your technical skillsets becomes secondary, however you have the autonomy to balance your level of technical skill upkeep with the priorities and needs of your team.

### Recommendations and Considerations
Recommendations to explore this path:

- Read about [what you can expect in a Support Engineering Manager role](/job-families/engineering/support-management/#what-you-can-expect-in-a-manager-support-engineering-role-at-gitlab).
- Read about the [Support Engineering Manager Responsibilities](/handbook/support/managers/manager-responsibilities.html).
- Read about why [candidates should apply for a Support Manager role](/job-families/engineering/support-management/#you-should-apply-if) to understand general expectations of this role.
- Read [Transitioning from Individual Contributor to Manager](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/engineers/training/ic-to-manager/).
- Read about [Individual Contribution vs. Management](/handbook/engineering/career-development/#individual-contribution-vs-management) and [Trying the Management Track](/handbook/engineering/career-development/#trying-the-management-track).
- Read about the [Interim Manager](/handbook/engineering/career-development/#interim-manager) role.

Considerations when building your path:

- Consider experiences beyond what you have accomplished at GitLab (previous job experiences or even personal accomplishments) that can be used as supportive examples for building your case to transition into a manager role.
- As you begin to track and document your path to promotion document for moving into a management role, use meaningful examples that highlight the following:
    - You have the level of confidence needed to initiate change, address challenging situations, and make difficult decisions.
    - You have the ability to show humility and accept pushback or failure.
    - You have the ability to accept accountability in support of an individual, the team, our customers, and the business.
    - You have the ability to influence positive change (improvements), starting at the individual level.
    - You have the ability to build (not demand) trust and respect with team members ranging from peers to direct reports to team members and executives across the entire organization.
