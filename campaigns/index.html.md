## Integrated Campaigns Overview
{: #integrated-campaigns .gitlab-purple}

The goal of a GitLab integrated campaign is to strategically land a cohesive message to a target audience across a variety of channels and offers, dependent on the goals of the campaign. Content types include a combination of blog posts, webinars, whitepapers, reports, videos, case studies, and more. Activation of the campaigns takes place in a number of marketing channels include digital ads, social, paid social, SEO, PR, email, and more.

**[Campaign Managers](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/)** are responsible for the strategizing of integrated campaigns and organizing timelines and DRIs for deliverables to execute on the campaigns.

In an effort to continually improve our ability to derive success of campaigns, reporting is a focus using Bizible data in Sisense. [Issue here for more information on progress](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/issues/982)

**Questions? Please feel free to ask in the [#marketing-campaigns slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCWUCP4MS) or ask in the [#marketing slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C0AKZRSQ5) and tag @marketing-campaigns.**

### Campaign Core Teams
{: #campaign-core-teams}

A `Campaign Core Team` is led by a [Marketing Campaign Manager](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/) and is comprised of functional DRIs across marketing and revenue programs.

**Campaign core team members:**
* Campaigns (DRI)
* Product Marketing
* Technical Marketing
* Content Marketing
* Revenue Programs
* Brand
* Corporate Marketing (Liaison for activation)
* Field Marketing (Liaison for activation)

**About Campaign Core Teams:**
- The Core Team's purpose is to collaborate on the research, positioning, messaging, general strategy, and overall timeline of the campaign, and related value plays.
- The Core Teams will determine a relevant and realistic timeline in line with overarching marketing themes, and including Campaigns and Value Plays.
- Each team member should formally commit to due dates for their work.
- Each team member is responsible for communicating as soon as possible when a due date is at risk.
- The Core Teams are comprised of functional DRIs from teams aligned to product specializations (SMEs within their teams)
- The Core Teams will kickoff together with the freedom to drive their campaigns as desired and with a strong team-oriented approach
- The Core Teams will ensure nothing happens in a vacuum, by proactively integrating corresponding activities across marketing, and including those beyond the core team for input
- The Core Teams are responsible for clearly communicating plans to all of Marketing ([also see Core Team communication](/handbook/marketing/campaigns/#core-team-communication))

#### Campaign Core Team Communication
{: #core-team-communication}

How to keep all teams in the loop will be a key responsibility of the Core Teams, and planning should not happen in silos. Continual communication of plans, progress, and how to leverage the GTM Motion collateral will be a key to success in the FY22 Marketing Plan.

The teams are encouraged to contribute ideas and processes for communication here in the handbook throughout FY22.

### What is in a campaign bundle?
{: #campaign-bundles}

Think of a **campaign bundle** as the foundational pieces of an integrated campaign. They are used by all teams in marketing and sales to maintain a cohesive message and branding across all tactics and activities aligned to the topical campaign.

_The list below includes recommended items included in a **Campaign Bundle**, which is developed by the Campaign Core Team consisting of Campaigns, Product Marketing, Technical Marketing, Content Marketing, and Digital Marketing.

To see a visual of campaign bundles, which are then leveraged in activation plans, please see [this MURAL](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1619125370999/270c2d5df5a535223c053f2dba0d06833f9b92d1?sender=jgragnola2053).

**What is included in a Campaign Bundle?**
* Target personas
* Persona-based positioning and messaging
* Market landscape
* Product capabilities
* Content journey (including awareness, consideration, and decision stages)
* Analyst relations content (if available)
* Customer references
* Emails for content in buyer journey
* Creative for ads, emails, landing pages
* Alliance partner joint GTM campaigns and activities
* Channel partner "Instant Campaigns"
* Outreach sequences/templates

## How are campaign bundles activated?

## How do we measure performance??
{: #campaign-performance}
We leverage multi-touch attribution reporting in Sisense to help us understand which campaigns, activities, and channels drive the best results, with a goal of SAO and Pipeline. We review these metrics at a segment/region breakout level, as well as reviewing overall campaign metrics with the campaign core teams to identify optimization opportunities to maximize results.

Our dashboards are owned and managed by the Marketing Strategy and Performance team. [Learn more in the Bizible Handbook >>](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible)

## Campaign Planning
{: #campaign-planning .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**There will be an epic for every campaign - created by the Campaign Manager managing the campaign.**

* The campaign will have a clear launch date
* All action items will have DRIs and a timeline, working back from the launch date
* The campaign will be determined at least 45 days prior to launch to allow for a proactive, not reactive, timeline

Ideally, campaigns will be agreed at least a quarter in advance to allow for ample planning and execution, prep time with agencies, creative concepting, and communication internally. This is a collaborative effort to deliver a cohesive program.

#### Overall Campaign Steps
{: #campaign-steps}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

* **Campaign and launch date is determined by Marketing Leadership**
* **Assign:** Campaign Manager is assigned
* **Assign:** Marketing team leaders assign DRIs from their teams
* **Meeting:** Campaign Manager organizes campaign kickoff call with early-stage DRIs (Campaign Manager, DMP, PMM, TMM)
* **Meeting:** Campaign Manager organizes campaign brief call with early-stage DRIs (Campaign Manager, DMP, PMM, TMM)
* **Plan:** Campaign Manager creates project plan (GANTT chart) with timelines and DRIs
* **Plan:** Campaign Manager creates the epic and related issues, including the due dates and DRIs from project plan
* **Meeting:** Campaign Manager organizes the bi-weekly 30 minute check-in call to cover milestones met and determine any blockers/at-risk action items
* **Async:** *DRIs are responsible for delivering by their due dates, with timeline adherence being critical due to dependencies for later tasks to be completed by other teams*
* **Reporting:** Campaign Manager organizes reporting issue with clear DRI to include overall metrics and more detailed drill-in by channel (one month post-launch)
* **Optimization:** Campaign Manager creates issues for optimizing the landing page, channels, etc. and assigning to relevant DRIs
