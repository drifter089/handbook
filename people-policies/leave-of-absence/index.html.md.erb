### Military Leave

GitLab is committed to protecting the rights of team members absent on military leave. No team member or prospective team member will be subjected to any form of discrimination on the basis of membership in or obligation to perform service for any of the uniformed services of their country of residency. If any team member believes that he or she has been subjected to discrimination in violation of this policy, immediately contact People Business Partners for assistance. For any questions about how to initiate a military leave, please contact People Operations. For GitLab Inc or GitLab Federal team members, please additionally review the [Military Leave](/handbook/people-policies/leave-of-absence/us/#military-leave) policy.
