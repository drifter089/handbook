## Company-Wide Leave of Absence Policies

GitLab's leave policies are intended to provide team members time away from work to care for themselves as they recover from a serious health condition, care for a family member recovering from a serious health condition, to bond with a newborn or a newly placed child for adoption.  

This page is designed to educate our team members about the different GitLab-specific leave policies available.  Whenever allowed by law these leave programs are coordinated and run concurrently any entity specific leaves a team member may be eligible for.

### Parental Leave

GitLab's paid Parental Leave is for any team member (regardless of gender) who becomes a parent through child birth or adoption.  To learn more about our Parental Leave policy and eligibility requirements, please refer to the [Parental Leave](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave) section in our handbook. 

### COVID-19 Medical Leave Policy

GitLab has long believed in ["family and friends first‚Äù](/handbook/values/#family-and-friends-first-work-second) and we realize that our team members may require some additional time away from work in the event they or a dependent family member are directly affected by COVID-19. In order to best support our team members who find themselves or family member(s) directly affected by COVID-19, GitLab has created this [COVID-19 Medical Leave Policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/covid-19/#covid-19-medical-leave-policy) to allow for leave time explicitly and guaranteed.  While this situation is ever evolving, we will continue to monitor and update this policy as needed.  

### Military Leave

GitLab is committed to protecting the rights of team members absent on military leave. No team member or prospective team member will be subjected to any form of discrimination on the basis of membership in or obligation to perform service for any of the uniformed services of their country of residency. If any team member believes that he or she has been subjected to discrimination in violation of this policy, immediately contact People Business Partners for assistance. For any questions about how to initiate a military leave, please contact People Operations. For GitLab Inc or GitLab Federal team members, please additionally review the [Military Leave](/handbook/people-policies/leave-of-absence/us/#military-leave) policy.

Your Absence Managment team is here to help before, during, or after your leave.  If you have any questions related to your time away after reviewing this page, please contact `leaves@gitlab.com` to discuss or request a 1:1 with the Absence Management team.
