Product operations work happens in alignment with GitLab's [product development timeline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline), releasing on the 22nd of every month. However, in order to avoid overlap with the product release peak work time and allow teams have bandwidth to understand and adopt updates into their workflow, product operations release notes will push between the 23rd and 30th of every month, and be adjusted as needed around holidays and weekends.
