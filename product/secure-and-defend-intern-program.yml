## Overview
The best way to learn about something is by doing something. The best feedback
comes directly from working with end-users and the product directly. At GitLab,
we have the opportunity to get more direct product feedback and help folks
learn more about security at the same time.

We will begin offering the opportunity for folks interested in learning more
about security an internship focused on adding our Secure and Defend features
to open source projects hosted on GitLab.com.

## Internship scope
Each iteration of the internship will be slightly different, depending on the
intern's interests and expertise, the specific open-source projects involved,
as well as the mentor.

General goals of the internships are:

1. Identify a GitLab-hosted open-source project that would benefit from
  security scanning.
1. Integrate various GitLab security scanners into the projects CI pipelines.
1. Contribute patches and fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
1. File bug reports and commit small enhancements to GitLab scanners.
1. Write a report and create collateral detailing their experience and the
  steps above.

Before starting the internship program, the intern and mentor should have a
kickoff call to understand the intern's interest, skills, and availability to
then figure out specific goals to drive towards.

## Benefits
This program benefits everyone involved in a variety of different ways.
