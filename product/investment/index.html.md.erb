title: Product Investment
---

This page is meant to provide insight into how we consider and allocate our investment across our [Product Hierarchy](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy).

## Investment Types

We track product investment across three types:

1. Revenue investments:  Direct impact on our ability to drive revenue within the next 12 months. Some examples of this investment type are: ARR drivers prioritized by the sales team, improved usability of core high use workflows that drive [SUS](/handbook/engineering/ux/performance-indicators/system-usability-scale/), improvements that help with retention, expansion and product supportability.
1. Usage investments:  Limited or growing customer adoption traction (>5% of monthly active usage), and on path to driving revenue within 12-36 months.  The goal in the next 12 months is to establish and drive additional product usage and maturity. Examples of this type of investment type are: Building good usability and embracing the working-by-default principle to spur adoption, gain feedback and reduce cycle time. This type of investment includes MVCs from [Product Groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups) as their intent is to drive usage of our single application.
1. New markets investments:  Low or No customer adoption.  These are long-term bets to help us expand our Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) over a 3-5 year time horizon.  The goal for the next 12 months is to establish demonstrated customer adoption. Examples of this are our investment in [Single-Engineer groups](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#single-engineer-groups)

The investment mix between these three categories will shift over time as our business matures.  By 2024 we would expect the investment mix to look like:

1. Revenue - 65%
1. Usage - 25%
1. New markets - 10%

## Investment by DevOps and Enabling Stages

### DevOps Stage Scoring Framework

We have a framework we use to assess the investment level for each DevOps stage.  The three investment drivers are as follows:

1. Product Usage Driver Score is a measure of the number of active users per month for that stage
2. Revenue Driver score is a measure of the ability of that stage to increase revenue through higher [ASP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/#sts=Average%20Sales%20Price%20(ASP)) or seat adds
3. SAM (Served Addressable Market) Driver score is a measure of the size of the DevOps market that stage enables GitLab to serve over the next three years

Each driver is scored on a 1-5 basis.  Here is a description of how each driver is scored.

| Score | Usage Driver Key | Revenue Driver Key | SAM Driver Key |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 1 | <10k SMAU | Not a driver of paid sales | <200m SAM over the next three years |
| 2 | 10k-50k SMAU | <25% of features in paid tiers; not a major element in paid sales | 200m-500m SAM over the next three years |
| 3 | 50k-100k SMAU | >25% of features in paid tiers; not a major element in paid sales | 500m-1B SAM over the next three years |
| 4 | 100k-200k SMAU | Key element in Premium sales | 1B-2B SAM over the next 3 years |
| 5 | >200k SMAU | Key element in Ultimate sales | >2B SAM over the next three years |

### Enabling Stage Scoring Framework

We score enabling groups differently. Their Criticality of Use score replaces their Usage score and their Degree of Enablement replaces their SAM Score. Enabling groups utilize the same scoring methodology as DevOps stage groups for their Revenue Driver score.

1. Criticality of Use score is a measure of how critical the enabling categories are to the usage of GitLab. 
2. Degree of Enablement score is a measure of much the enabling categories expand the enablement of GitLab to the DevOps market in terms of percent of the SAM it enables.

As for DevOps stage scores - each driver is scored on a 1-5 basis.  Here is a description of how each driver is scored.

| Score | Criticality of Use | Degree of Enablement |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 | Non-essential to use of GitLab |  Enables < 25% of the DevOps Market|
| 2 | Non-essential but becoming more critical | Enables > 25% of the DevOps Market |
| 3 | Essential but not required | Enables >50% of the DevOps Market |
| 4 | Heavily recommmended for use of GitLab or GitLab.com | Enables >70% of the DevOps Market |
| 5 | Required for use of GitLab or GitLab.com | Enables entire DevOps Market |

### Investment by Stage

The following table provides scores for each of our DevOps stages and a comparison of the total score to our current development spend allocation as defined by the percentage of total individual contributor developers in product groups.

### Investment by Group

*Note: Enablement and Growth stages and groups aren't included, as they don't have specific target markets, and don't have a dedicated SAM.  Therefore, they can't be compared directly with feature-function stages and aren't included in this analysis.*

## All Investment
For non-DevOps and Enabling stages we still track our overall investment, but don't attribute score or score/spend differences.

<% totalAllDevelopers = 0 %>
<% data.sections.each do |sectionKey, section| %>
  <% data.stages.stages.select{|stageKey,stage| stage.section==sectionKey}.each do |stageKey, stage| %>
    <% stage.groups.each do |groupKey, group| %>
      <% totalAllDevelopers += team_member_count_from_groups(groups: [group.be_team_tag, group.fe_team_tag, group.fs_team_tag])%>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

      <%= "| #{groupLine.join(' | ')} |" if groupLine %>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

## Total and Served Addressable Markets

Served Addressable Market (SAM) is a key driver of our stage level investment. We calculate our SAM based on what percentage of the total addressable market is serviceable by our current products. Here is our future Total Addressable Market (TAMkt) for 2024, percent addressable, and SAM for each stage which are used to determine our [SAM Driver score](#devops-stage-scoring-framework).

<% totalTAMkt = 0 %>
<% totalSAM = 0 %>
| Stage | 2024 TAMkt | % Served | 2024 SAM |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
<% data.addressable_markets.each do |stage| %>
  <% stageLine=[] %>
  <% sam = (stage.percent_servicable.to_f/100)*stage.tamkt.to_f %>
  <% stageLine << "#{stage.stage}"%>
  <% stageLine << "$#{number_with_delimiter(stage.tamkt, :delimiter => ',')}M" if stage.tamkt %>
  <% totalTAMkt += stage.tamkt.to_f %>
  <% stageLine << "[#{stage.percent_servicable}%](#{stage.serviceable_url})" if stage.serviceable_url %>
  <% stageLine << "#{stage.percent_servicable}%" if !stage.serviceable_url %>
  <% stageLine << "$#{number_with_delimiter(sam.round(0), :delimiter => ',')}M" %>
  <% totalSAM += sam.round(0) %>
  <%= "| #{stageLine.join(' | ')} |" if stageLine %>
<% end %>
<%= "| <b>Total</b> | $#{number_with_delimiter(totalTAMkt.round(0), :delimiter => ',')}M | #{(totalSAM/totalTAMkt*100).round(2)}% | $#{number_with_delimiter(totalSAM.round(0), :delimiter => ',')}M |"%>

_Note_ - It is difficult to find data sources that allow us to break down our TAMkt (and therefore) SAM by stages, groups and categories. The primary reference for this data is the [2020 IDC Worldwide DevOps Software Tools Market Shares report - internal](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ulsSwvL_PUImVJc3r9wE0iDw1D_k1ijQ?usp=sharing) as it is the third party market size analysis that most closely maps to our overall product scope. We used the IDC report, plus some additional market analyses, to then derive a [TAMkt estimate for each stage - internal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LO57cmXHDjE4QRf6NscRilpYA1mlXHeLFwM_tWlzcwI/edit?ts=5ddb7489#gid=1474156035). For historical growth and geographical distribution used as an input in planning GTM investments, we also publish a TAMkt estimate using a [different methodology](/handbook/sales/tam/)  derived by multiplying the estimated number of potential users by GitLab's potential annual average revenue per user (ARPU). 

## Changes

### Changes in Scoring and Addressable Markets

Changes to this page are made by adding new values to the single sources of truth ([categories.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/categories.yml), [stages.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/stages.yml) and [addressable_markets.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/addressable_markets.yml)) and then editing this page in order to display those values in table form. Be sure the definition for any column value is defined in [stage](/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/digital-experience/website/#stage-attributes) and [category attributes](/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/digital-experience/website/#category-attributes) and that the column headers link to those definitions.

The process for making changes requires you to submit a merge request to the [stages.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/stages.yml) for the specific keywords that have changed and provide the data source for that change. Assign the merge request to the EVP or VP of Product and slack `#product` for approval/merge. You can reference the [Release Stage update](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/62103) for an example.

### Changes in Levels of Investment

We have a few methods for adjusting the level of investment (team members) allocated to groups and categories. We can:
- Within the Development department declare a short-term [rapid action](/handbook/engineering/development/#rapid-action) to deliver on specific priorities
- Implement a medium-term [headcount reset](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritize-global)
- [Realign](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#realignment-of-team-members-impacting-multiple-teams) team members to higher priority product groups for longer-term efforts, for guidance on requesting a realignment see [Product Group Realignment Guidance Handbook Page](/handbook/product/product-processes/#requesting-a-realignment-of-engineering-teammates)
- Approve [new incremental investment](#new-incremental-investment) in the form of hiring

#### New Incremental Investment

For new incremental R&D investment not related to Product Groups, Functional Leaders (in Support, Security, Infrastructure, UX and Quality) can directly propose increased investment in our [R&D Investment Priorities](#references) and pinging the CProdO and CTO. 

For new incremental R&D investment within Product Groups the investment request must:
- Be listed in the +10 Investment Priorities within the Section Direction ([example](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#10-investment-priorities))
- Include a business case issue ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2178)) that explains the specific overview/background, proposal and impact of the investment
- Complete review and approval from VP, Product Management

Only if those conditions are met should new investment requests be added to the [R&D Investment Priorities](#references) for prioritization by the CProdO and CTO.  

Here's the monthly process for reviewing and approving items:
1. To add a new item to the sheet, please send supporting details for the line item to Kristie Thomas, and she will add it to the sheet
1. If you believe the item is important and should be considered for funding in the next quarter, please have Kristie bold the item
1. The CTO and CProdO will conduct a monthly synchronous review with functional leaders of the business cases for items up for review. In this review currently prioritized items (marked in yellow) plus new high priority items (marked in bold) will be reviewed and prioritized against each other as a group. The final DRIs for this prioritization are the CTO and CProdO.
1. Each quarter the CTO and CProdO will partner with Finance to define the budget (if any) for incremental R&D hiring, and will open up new job requisitions for all new roles to be hired
1. Once a role has been funded and opened it will be removed from the R&D Investment Priorities sheet
