## Overview
The best way to learn about something is by doing it. The best feedback
comes directly from working with end-users and the product directly. At GitLab,
we have the opportunity to get more direct product feedback and help folks
learn more about security at the same time.

We will begin offering the opportunity for folks interested in learning more
about security an internship focused on adding our Secure and Defend features
to open source projects hosted on GitLab.com.

## Internship scope
Each iteration of the internship will be slightly different, depending on the
intern's interests and expertise, the specific open-source projects involved,
as well as the mentor.

General goals of the internships are:

1. Identify a GitLab-hosted open-source project that would benefit from
  security scanning.
1. Integrate various GitLab security scanners into the projects CI pipelines.
1. Contribute patches and fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
1. File bug reports and commit small enhancements to GitLab scanners.
1. Write a report and create collateral detailing their experience and the
  steps above.

Before starting the internship program, the intern and mentor should have a
kickoff call to understand the intern's interest, skills, and availability to
then figure out specific goals to drive towards.

## Benefits
This program benefits everyone involved in a variety of different ways.

### For the Intern
1. Learn industry-leading, modern DevSecOps practices and workflows.
1. Learn about the latest security scanners and techniques, like SAST, DAST,
  Fuzz Testing, Container Scanning, and more as well as how to apply them in
  real-world scenarios.
1. Learn about new open-source software projects and how to contribute.
1. Learn about all-remote working environments.
1. Learn more about GitLab, our users, and how they use our products, which
  can help in your full time role.

### For the Open Source projects
1. Security testing in open source projects can identify bugs and
  vulnerabilities to be fixed.
1. Assistance in patching any identified issues.
1. Additional contributions to open source projects helps keep those projects
  active and maintained

### For GitLab
1. Additional use of our scanners to learn more about what works well and what can be improved.
1. Opportunity to showcase GitLab as a go-to place to host open source projects.
1. Real-world examples to share with customers of our scanners.
1. Ability to identify and hire exceptional interns.
- Valuable feedback that can help drive better product decisions.

### For the mentor
1. Get direct access to an "end-user" to better understand their perspective
  and challenges.
1. Get practice acting as a mentor and coach.


## What to do

This section provides general guidance on what the internship would look like.
It is meant to be demonstrative, not prescriptive, and based on what has worked
for past iterations. The mentor and intern are responsible for setting the
schedule and deliverables that make sense for them.

### Define the goals
At the start of the internship, the mentor and intern should decide what the goals
of the internship are. This should include some hands-on application of a GitLab
security tool to some open source project. This is the critical piece that
helps the intern learn, provides GitLab good feedback, and that benefits the
open source project.

### Deliver on the goals
The majority of the internship should be spent _doing_, rather than talking
about doing. To that end, a big piece of the internship should be spent on
working with the open source projects directly, rather than working with
GitLab teams.

### Share your experiences
At the end of the internship, the intern should produce some sort of content
about their time in the program and what they did. This could be a blog, a
YouTube video, conference presentation, or anything that is agreed upon. The
goal is to be able to share with others about what was done and give the intern
something tangible they can point to in the future.

### Example schedule

To make the above a bit more concrete, here is an example of what a four-week
long internship might look like.

| Week | Description |
| 1 | Identify OSS projects to work with, scanners to add, and introduce self to the maintainers. |
| 2 | Write MRs to add scanners to the projects. |
| 3 | Continue with MRs to add scanners to the projects. Start addressing vulnerabilities found by the scanners. |
| 4 | Finalize or handoff any open MRs to maintainers. Write blog about experience. |

### Interns

1. Discuss your interest with your current manager.
1. Schedule a coffee chat with one of the mentors above to go through your
  interests, your availability (both calendar time and in % of your work hours),
  and see if there is a good fit.
1. Create a new issue for an [Internship for Learning](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#internship-for-learning)
  and follow that process.

### Mentors
If you are willing to act as a mentor for the program, you should do a few
things:

1. Discuss your desire to be a mentor with your own manager.
1. Decide what product areas of focus you'd like the intern to focus on (SAST, DAST, etc)
  and that you'd feel comfortable coaching. This is important in case an intern
  is interested in an area you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with.
1. Add your availability and name to the chart above.

### Open-source projects
If you are an open-source project hosted on GitLab.com, we would love to have
you work with one of our interns as part of this program! If you're interested,
please create an issue and tag us! If you haven't already, consider also
applying for our GitLab [Open Source Program](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/program/)
