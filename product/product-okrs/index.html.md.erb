## GitLab OKRs

GitLab uses the OKR (Objective and Key Results) framework to set and track goals on a quarterly basis. You can read more about OKRs at GitLab OKRs including the overall process as well as current and past OKRs [here](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/). Every department participates in OKRs to collaboratively goal set across the organization. GitLab does quarterly objectives which align with our Fiscal Year. 

## Product OKRs

Product FY22-Q2 OKRs are tracked as Epics [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics?scope=all&state=opened&search=FY22-Q2+OKR) and the KRs are tracked as Issues in the [Product project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product) and on the [OKR Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/boards/906048?label_name%5B%5D=OKR). Starting in FY22-Q2, they are also also in [Ally.io](ADD DIRECT LINK to product section of Ally) so  we can get familiar with the tool before FY22-Q3. Starting in FY22-Q3, we're aiming to replace use of epics, issues and boards and fully port all OKRs into Ally.io. Details on that process and instructions on how to participagte will be added to this page as they solidify. 

### Product OKR Process

Each organization at GitLab may follow a slightly personalized process for OKRs. Below is the process for Product. Product works closely with Engineering and collaborates on some Objectives and Key Results. You can reference the Engineering's process [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#engineering-okr-process).

The Product OKRs are initiated by the Chief Product Officer each quarter per the details and timeline below:

#### FY22-Q2 Product OKR Process


##### OKR Kick-off by the Product Leadership Team

- **5 weeks** prior to the start of the fiscal quarter, the CEO and Chief of Staff initiate the OKR process. The CEO will share an MR in the #e-group Slack channel with the 3 Company Objectives for the quarter, and one to three Key Results for each objective.
- **4 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter the Chief Product Officer will draft their OKRs in a GitLab issues in the [Product Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues) and review the drafted Product OKRs with the CEO.
- **3 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, the CEO approves the OKRs and the Chief Product Officer shares the OKRs ut with the [product leadership](ADD LINK) team for alignment and to finalize ownership of the KRs to specific product team members. 
- **2 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, the EBA to the Chief Product Officer will port the finalized OKRs into [Ally.io](ADD GENERAL LINK) and assign the Objectives and Key Results to the designated owners, as specified by the Chief Product Officer in the finalized Gitlab epics/issues.
     - The EBA will align the Product OKRs to their corresponding parent-level OKRs so everything cascades from the Company Objectives set by the CEO and Chief of Staff.
     - The EBA will link the OKR descriptions in Ally.io to the related GitLab epics/issues for ease of reference to the final SSOT.

##### OKR Collaboration by the rest of Product Team

- Team members who own specific OKRs will update the status in the relevant GitLab epics/issues as appropriate every 4 weeks and ping any relevant stakeholders. For example, since Q2 begins May 1, KR owners will provide status as needs by  June 1 and by July 1. 
     - They will also direct link to the update in the GitLab epic/issue in the Ally.io OKR description to maintain a clear reference to the SSOT. 
- Team members who own specific OKRs will update [the score](ADD LINK to score definitions) in Ally.io  every 4 weeks and tag any relevant stakeholders

For an overview of how Product is currently using Ally.io and how to do some basic tasks, check out this [video](ADD LINK TO A VIDEO BY THE AMAZING KT?!?)

#### FY22-Q3 Product OKR Process

- As of FY22-Q3 we'll have an updated process to fully leverage Ally.io as SSOT for OKRs and sunset usage of GitLab epics/issues. Details forthcoming...
