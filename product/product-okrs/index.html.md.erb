## GitLab OKRs

GitLab uses the OKR (Objective and Key Results) framework to set and track goals on a quarterly basis. You can read more about OKRs at GitLab OKRs including the overall process as well as current and past OKRs [here](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/). Every department participates in OKRs to collaboratively goal set across the organization. GitLab does quarterly objectives which align with our Fiscal Year. 

## Product OKRs

Product FY22-Q2 OKRs are tracked as Epics [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics?scope=all&state=opened&search=FY22-Q2+OKR) and the KRs are tracked as Issues in the [Product project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product) and on the [OKR Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/boards/906048?label_name%5B%5D=OKR). Starting in FY22-Q2, they are also also in [Ally.io](ADD DIRECT LINK to product section of Ally) so  we can get familiar with the tool before FY22-Q3. Starting in FY22-Q3, we're aiming to replace use of epics, issues and boards and fully port all OKRs into Ally.io. Details on that process and instructions on how to participagte will be added to this page as they solidify. 

### Product OKR Process

Each organization at GitLab may follow a slightly personalized process for OKRs. Below is the process for Product. Product works closely with Engineering and collaborates on some Objectives and Key Results. You can reference the Engineering's process [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#engineering-okr-process).

The Product OKRs are initiated by the Chief Product Officer each quarter per the details and timeline below:

#### FY22-Q2 Product OKR Process

- **5 weeks** prior to the start of the fiscal quarter, the CEO and Chief of Staff initiate the OKR process. The CEO will share an MR in the #e-group Slack channel with the 3 Company Objectives for the quarter, and one to three Key Results for each objective.
- **4 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter the Chief Product Officer will draft their OKRs in a GitLab issues in the [Product Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues) and review the drafted Product OKRs with the CEO.
- **3 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, the CEO approves the OKRs and the Chief Product Officer shares the OKRs ut with the [product leadership](ADD LINK) team for alignment and to finalize ownership of the KRs to specific product team members. 
- 2 weeks prior to the start of teh new quarter, the EBA to the Chief Product Officer will port the finalized OKRs into Ally.io and assign the Objectives and Key Results to the designated owners, specified by the Chief Product Officer in the finalized Gitlab epics/issues. The EBA will also align the Product  OKRs to their corresponding parent-level OKRs so that everything cascades from the Company Objectives set by the CEO and Chief of Staff. The EBA will link the OKRs description in Ally.io to the related GitLab epics/issues for ease of referece to the final SSOT. 
- Team Members who own Objectives and Key Results will update the status in the relevant epics/issues as appropriate every 4 weeks.
