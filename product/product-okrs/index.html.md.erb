## GitLab OKRs

GitLab uses the [OKR (Objective and Key Results) framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4N1q4RNi9I) to set and track goals on a quarterly basis. You can read more about OKRs at GitLab OKRs including the overall process as well as current and past OKRs [here](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/). Every department participates in OKRs to collaboratively goal set across the organization. GitLab does quarterly objectives which align with our Fiscal Year. 

## Product OKRs

Currently, Product team OKRs are tracked as Epics [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics?scope=all&state=opened&search=FY22-Q2+OKR) and the KRs are tracked as Issues in the [Product project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product) and on the [Product OKR Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/boards/906048?label_name%5B%5D=OKR). Starting in FY22-Q2, all OKRs are also in [Ally.io](https://app.ally.io/teams/39480/objectives?tab=0&time_period_id=135090) so  we can get familiar with the tool before FY22-Q3. Starting in FY22-Q3, we're aiming to replace use of GitLab epics, issues and boards and fully port all OKRs into Ally.io. Details on that process and instructions on how to participate will be added to this page as they solidify. 

To learn more about the rollout process for Product and Engineering see the linked [Ally OKR Rollout GitLab Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/ally-okr-rollout).

### Product OKR Process

Each organization at GitLab may follow a slightly personalized process for OKRs. Below is the process for Product. Product works closely with Engineering and collaborates on some Objectives and Key Results. You can reference the Engineering's process [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#engineering-okr-process).

The Product OKRs are initiated by the Chief Product Officer each quarter per the details and timeline below. 

#### FY22-Q2 Product OKR Process

##### OKR Kick-off by the Product Leadership Team

_Please note that the FY22-Q2 process is a "hybrid" model as we continue to leverage Gitlab epics and issues as SSOT for OKR content but shift to scoring OKRs in Ally.io.  We fully transition into Ally.io in FY22-Q3. Thank you for your patience!_

- **5 weeks** prior to the start of the fiscal quarter, the CEO and Chief of Staff initiate the OKR process. The CEO will share an MR in the #e-group Slack channel with the 3 Company Objectives for the quarter, and one to three Key Results for each objective.
- **4 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter the Chief Product Officer will draft their OKRs in a GitLab issue in the [Product Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues) and review the drafted Product OKRs with the CEO.
- **3 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, the CEO approves the OKRs and the Chief Product Officer shares the OKRs with the [product leadership](/handbook/product/product-leadership/) team for alignment and to finalize ownership of the KRs to specific product team members. 
- **2 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, the EBA to the Chief Product Officer will port the finalized OKRs into [Ally.io](https://app.ally.io/teams/39480/objectives?tab=0&time_period_id=135090) and assign the Objectives and Key Results to the designated owners, as specified by the Chief Product Officer in the finalized Gitlab epics/issues.
     - The EBA will align the Product OKRs to their corresponding parent-level OKRs so everything cascades from the Company Objectives set by the CEO and Chief of Staff.
     - The EBA will link the OKR descriptions in Ally.io to the related GitLab epics/issues for ease of reference to the final SSOT.

##### OKR Collaboration by the rest of Product Team

**Updating the status of Product OKRs**

- Team members who **own** specific OKRs will update the status in the relevant GitLab epics/issues as appropriate every 4 weeks and ping any relevant stakeholders. For example, since FY22-Q2 begins May 1, KR owners will provide status as needs by  June 1 and by July 1. 
     - It is recommended to direct link to the monthly update in the GitLab epic/issue in the Ally.io OKR description to maintain a clear reference to the SSOT. 
- Team members who **own** specific OKRs will update [the score](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/#scoring-okrs) in Ally.io every 4 weeks and tag any relevant stakeholders

**Note:** OKR owners will get reminders via Slack/Ally.io on or near the first of each month to do this. To set up more reminders or opt out of reminders, check out [how to use Ally.io](#how-to-use-allyio)   

#### FY22-Q3 Product OKR Process

_In FY22-Q3/Q4 we'll have an updated process to fully leverage Ally.io as SSOT for OKRs and sunset usage of GitLab epics/issues. Details forthcoming._

##### KR Creation by Product Groups

- **8 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, **TBD person/role** will create the planning Issue for Product Group OKRs. This issue will be used as a place for teams suggest and draft their proposed  Quad OKRs in the issue comments.
   - [FY22-Q2 Quad OKR Planning Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2095)
   - [FY22-Q3 Quad OKR Planning Issue](to be created)
- **8 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, the [EBA to the Chief Product Officer](LINK to KT) will create [FY22-Q3 Planning Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1509) containing separate issues for each 1-year product theme and tags in [Product Operations](LINK to Farnoosh).
     - Product Operations will review and then tag all Group Managers of Product requesting they activate their product managers to propose product group KRs corresponding to one or more of the 1-year product themes as Objectives. 
     - GMPs will organize review and approval of their team's KRs at their discretion. However, product group KRs need to align to at least one of the known FY22 product themes.
     - Product managers will own and create product group KRs in partnership with their [Quad](LINK to what a quad is) 
     - Once the product group KRs are reviewed and approved as needed, PMs will add their aligned upon KRs to the description of the corresponding 1-year product theme issue. When adding KRs to the issue description the following format should be used: INSERT FORMAT FROM JACKIE'S Q2 ISSUES AS SAMPLE
     - Product managers will link any related KR epics or issues as appropriate to the corresponding 1-year product theme issue

- **6 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, GMPs have their manager review their team's KRs as needed. Once reviewed and aligned as needed, GMPs will add the approved Quad OKRs to Ally.io. To learn how to access and use Ally, please check out [how to use Ally.io](#how to use Ally.io)
