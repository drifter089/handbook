### Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

Like all teams, the Product team participates in GitLab [OKRs](/company/okrs/).
The Product team OKRs are tracked as issues in the [Product project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product) and on the [OKR Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/boards/906048?label_name%5B%5D=OKR)

The process for doing so is:

- At the start of each quarter, after OKRs have been [reviewed and approved by the E-Group](/company/okrs/#how-to-achieve-presentation), Issues are created for
each key result with the issue title started with `DRI: KEY RESULT TITLE`. All issues should be tagged
with the `OKR` label, assigned the appropriate quarter Milestone and assigned a [health status.(https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/index.html#health-status) of on track, needs attention, or at risk.
- In the first two weeks of the quarter, every OKR should be assigned to a single [Product Leader](/handbook/product/product-leadership/). Most OKRs will consist of one or more sub-tasks required in order to satisfy the OKR and these sub-tasks will be assigned to individual Product Managers
or [Product Leadership](/handbook/product/product-leadership/#product-leaders) team members. The [company OKR page](/company/okrs/#quarterly-okrs) will be updated with links to the issues.
- While the [team is responsible for achieving the OKR](/company/okrs/#levels),
the assigned individual is responsible for:
    - Driving progress against the OKR within the team
    - Requesting and providing updates in relevant [team](#weekly-product-management-meeting) and [leadership meetings](#weekly-product-leadership-meeting)
    - Weekly updates to the issues including scoring (in the title) updates when needed
    - Monthly scoring updates to the [active company OKR document](/company/okrs/#quarterly-okrs)
- Final [scoring](/company/okrs/#scoring) is submitted in the final week of the quarter, and a retrospective is scheduled for the first week
of the following quarter.

## GitLab OKRs

GitLab uses the OKR (Objective and Key Results) framework to set and track goals on a quarterly basis. You can read more about OKRs, GitLab's OKR processes, and GitLab's actualy OKRs [here](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/).

## Product OKRs

Begininning in FY22-Q2 (2021-05-01 through 2021-2021-07-31), the Product and Engineering Divisions are using a third-party vendor, [Ally.io](https://ally.io/), for OKRs. 

The Product OKRs are drafted in a GitLab issue by the Chief Product Officer each quarter. Starting in FY22-Q2, the finalized Product OKRs are then created as Epics and Issues in GitLab AND as Objectives and Key Results in Ally by the EBA to the Chief Product Officer. Starting in FY22-Q3, they will be created ONLY in Ally as Objectives and Key Results.

#### Product OKR Process

Each organization at GitLab follows a slightly different process for OKRs. Below is the process for Product. The Product Organization works closely with Engineering and collaborates on some Objetives and Key Results. You can reference the Engineering Organizations's process [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#engineering-okr-process).

1. Chief Product Officer does X, Y, Z
1. Managers do X, Y, Z
1. Team Members do X, Y, Z
