## GitLab OKRs

GitLab uses the OKR (Objective and Key Results) framework to set and track goals on a quarterly basis. You can read more about OKRs, GitLab's OKR processes, and GitLab's actualy OKRs [here](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/).

## Product OKRs

Begininning in FY22-Q2 (2021-05-01 through 2021-2021-07-31), the Product and Engineering Divisions are using a third-party vendor, [Ally.io](https://ally.io/), for OKRs. 

The Product OKRs are drafted in a GitLab issue by the Chief Product Officer each quarter. Starting in FY22-Q2, the finalized Product OKRs are then created as Epics and Issues in GitLab AND as Objectives and Key Results in Ally by the EBA to the Chief Product Officer. Starting in FY22-Q3, they will be created ONLY in Ally as Objectives and Key Results. 

### Product OKRs by Quarter

#### Product OKR Process

Each organization at GitLab follows a slightly different process for OKRs. Below is the process for Product. The Product Organization works closely with Engineering and collaborates on some Objetives and Key Results. You can reference the Engineering Organizations's process [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#engineering-okr-process).

1. Chief Product Officer does X, Y, Z
1. Managers do X, Y, Z
1. Team Members do X, Y, Z
