It has never been more [popular](https://medium.com/agileinsider/incredible-growth-in-demand-for-product-managers-in-the-us-but-not-necessarily-in-the-places-youd-936fec5c1932) to be a product manager, 
but the responsibilities of a product manager can vary greatly between organizations and even within an organization.

## The Main PM Responsibilities
As a product manager at GitLab, you are primarily responsible for:

1. What we build is solving a defined problem for our users and customers
1. What we build is loved by our users and customers
1. What we build is viable in GitLab's [open core business model](https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/)

### How does a PM ensure they are solving a problem for our users?

### How does a PM ensure we build lovable products?

Producing a lovable products requires more than a deep understanding of the problem. At GitLab, we build lovable products by adhering to our [values](/handbook/values/). PMs are responsible to be the ambassador of the GitLab values by:

* Focusing on [results](/handbook/values/#results). 
* Embracing [iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration). This is the secret to GitLab moving fast, get constant feedback, and maintain forward momentum given GitLab's huge [vision](/direction/#vision) and PMs play a large role in unlocking iteration as a competency.
* Being [transparent](/handbook/values/#transparency). This will enable both our development group to contribute and just as important, enable the wider GitLab community to contribute.
* Being [efficient](/handbook/values/#efficiency). PMs should advocate for the boring solution, optimize for the right group, be the manager of one, always write things down, so they can help their groups also be efficient.
* Being [collaborative]. PMs ultimately don't ship anything on their own. PMs need to be a great teammate so that the development group can produce great work. 
* Being someone who helps make GitLab a work place of [diversity, inclusion, and belonging](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion), so that everyone can come to GitLab and do their best wrok.

### How does a PM ensure business viability for our product?

It is not sufficient to just know the problems. It is also insufficient to have a solution to the problem that our customers love. PMs also need to ensure that the solution is viable for GitLab.

* PMs participates in and follows the [product development flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) so that their development group can consistently release features [every month](/releases/). 
* PMs [determine the tiers of features](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#departments)
* PMs ensure that issues that impact GitLab are appropriately [prioritized](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization)
* Often times, tasks fall through the organizational cracks, PMs should take actions to ensure that the product remain viable.

## What is a PM not responsible for? 

To deeply understand the problems to solve, to build a lovable product, and to ensure the product is viable is not easy. It requires the Product Manager to be tenacious, influential, technically savvy, entrepreneurial, strategic, and many more adjectives. To support Product Managers, many processes and activities have been created. However, those activities are not necessarily the PM's responsibility. GitLab Product Managers maintain autonomy on what they do to achieve their core responsibilities.

* Anything that does not contribute directly to the PM's [core responsibilities](#the-core-pm-responsibilities).
* Design and usability. The PMs partner with their designer counter parts who are the main DRIs for the design and usability.
* Architecture and implementation. The PMs partner with their engineering counter parts who are the main DRIs for developing our product.
