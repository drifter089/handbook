## GitLab for Campuses

## Overview

GitLab provides educational institutions with three different options for using GitLab on their campus:
1. **GitLab for Education**: The GitLab for Education Program provides free, unlimited, licenses of GitLab's top-tiers, either self-hosted or Saas, to educational institutions for the *purposes of teaching, learning or research only**. Please see the [GitLab for Education handbook](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/education-program/) and [marketing pages](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/education/) for the more details.
2. Educational Standard Discount: GitLab licenses are available at a 20% standard discount off list price for any qualifying educational institution. There are no use-case restrictions on these licenses.
3. **GitLab for Campuses**: Qualifying educational institutions may purchase an enterprise campus-wide license. The campus-wide license offers unlimited seats (up to the last published enrollment of the institution) of GitLab's top-tiers, either self-hosted or Saas, for all non-profit generating activities on campus. This offering permits all (not-for-profit) use cases to occur within one license for the campus.


### Standard Education Discount
Qualifying educational institutions may receive a standard 20% discount off the current GitLab list price for each tier, either self-hosted or Saas. The discount will be applied at the discretion of the account owner and their regional sales leadership where applicable.

* The discount is available as of 2020-02-01. The discount will not be retroactively applied to close-won deals or true-ups.
* The discount can be applied at the time of the renewal if it is after 2020-02-01.
* The discount is not currently available to be purchases directly in the GitLab Customer Portal.

### GitLab for Campuses: Enterprise Offering
Qualifying educational institutions may purchase a campus-wide enterprise license.

Details:
* Only the top-tier of self-hosted and Saas are available in the campus-wide offering. Lower tiers are not available. The goal of this offering is provides all of campus with the best GitLab has to offer.
* A single campus-wide enterprise license can have an unlimited number of seats **up to** the most recent total student enrollment of the institution.
* The institution will provide documentation to the GitLab account owner for the most recent published student enrollment numbers (graduate and undergraduate) for within one year of the date of deal closing.
* The subscription at the agreed upon enrollment tier is valid for one year from the close date. No adjustments to the tier will be made during the subscription year.

- The unit (or SKU) is available to an **individual educational institution**.
- The appropriate SKU will be determined based on the total number of enrolled students at the institution for the last published year of data available.
- The institution may not request more seats than the last published enrollment number.
- The seats are available to all sub-units within the educational institution including campuses, colleges, schools, and divisions.
- The seats for each SKU are only available in the individual education institution and are not available outside of the institution.
- Each individual educational institution within a university, state, or national system much purchase an individual SKU. SKU/license cannot be shared across individual institutions within a system.


### Support
- An named single point of contact is provided for each college, school, or division within the institution. This reach expands to those units that serve as a primary tier administrative level for the institution. For example, the College of Engineering may have a named contact but the 8 individual departments within the College do not have a named support contact.
- The named contacts must be provided to GitLab and included in the support database.
- Individual students, faculty, and staff outside of the named single point of contact for each primary division cannot directly contact GitLab support.
