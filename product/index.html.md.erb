## Welcome to the Product Team Handbook

* Most of the content in the product handbook talks about *how* we do product at GitLab. 
* To learn more about *what* we are currently building and our product direction see [Product Direction](/direction). 
* Are you looking to talk to a Product Manager or collaborate with the Team see our [How to Engage](/handbook/product/how-to-engage) guide.

### Product Team Mission

**As a Product Org we strive to consistently create products and experiences that customers love and value.**

* **Consistency wins as you scal**.  Our organizational goal is to create a Product Manager (PM) system that maximizes the chances of success across new products, new features, and new team members.
* **We are shipping an experience**, and not just a product.  Donâ€™t forget about the links between the product and the website, pricing & packaging, documentation, sales, support, etc.
* **Itâ€™s about our customers and doing a job for them**, not the product itself.  Think externally about customer problems, not internally about the technology.
* **Itâ€™s about love AND value**.  Will customers value what we are building?  We need to make sure what we build helps build and extract customer value.

#### Changing the Product Handbook Content

This is the Product handbook. If you (a Product team member, a GitLab team-member, or anyone else) see any typos or small copywriting errors here, consider correcting them with a merge request and merging it yourself (provided you have merge permissions to this repository), and mentioning a [Product team member](/company/team/) afterward as a courtesy so that we can thank you, since we have a [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action) and trust your judgement. If you have a larger change (or don't have merge permissions), create a merge request and mention any Product team member for further review so that we can incorporate your change (if it makes sense) as soon as possible. Please don't assign anybody to the merge request.

##### Required Knowledge for Product Managers

<kbd class="required">Required ðŸ”Ž</kbd>

The Product handbook contains a lot of content that includes a mix of advice, best-practices,
mandatory process, team-specific content, and more. To help you find the most important
items, look for the badge below that indicate the most essential, important, and/or
obligatory processes that every Product Manager is expected to know by heart and follow,
as opposed to other items which may be more for reference in certain situations or may
be more optional than required. If you are adding or updating an essential handbook section,
consider adding this badge there.
