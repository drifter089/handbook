### Ownership of feature and experience areas

The GitLab application is built by many different product groups. In most cases this allows groups to proceed with a high degree of autonomy and contribute to any area of the product as needed. In some cases, however, groups may need to keep a higher level of support and oversight to contributions that impact their area. This can be especially important for areas of the product that have high usage, where impacts to the user experience can be challenging to understand without a more complete context.

Below is a guide to help other product groups understand how to work on these areas and quickly locate the best parties who may assist on the subject matter.

This section is modeled after the engineering handbook version of [ownership of shared services and components](/handbook/engineering/development/#ownership-of-shared-services-and-components).
