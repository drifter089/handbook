## General Guidelines

GitLab Legal has put together a comprehensive framework to help team members determine which information is internal only and that which can be shared publicly. Following the [SAFE framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/) will help you comply with the requirements of Regulation Fair Disclosure. 

### If you're not sure 

Please reach out to GitLab #SAFE in Slack and someone will be glad to assist you. 

###  Required Disclaimers

Please remember these artifacts should only contain information that is [SAFE](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/).

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What are some practical examples of things that are SAFE to share and those that need to remain internal-only?

| Situation | Classification | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Publicly discussing a group's MAU in an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/issues/386)| Not SAFE | We should avoid publicly disclosing MAU numbers |

#### Requesting a review from legal 

If you need a review from Legal, please ping `@Rashmi` or `@Heidi Loeffert` in [#legal](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C78E74A6L). A response will be provided within 48 hours.

#### What artifacts/actions can generally be published with a disclaimer? 

See the table above. If you are recording a video that requires a disclaimer but are not using a slidedeck, you may alternatively verbalize the disclaimer at the beginning of the video to avoid extra post-production work. 

#### What limitations do we have on sharing specific instrumentation data in public issues?

None, so long as the instrumentation data does not contain [sensitive](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#sensitive), [financial](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#financial), or [internal-only](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#internal) data.

#### What third-party materials (like images, diagrams, and quotes) can be included in publicly-available artifacts?

Guidelines covering the use of third-aprty materials are being prepared and will be linked here when ready. 

#### What third-party company and product names and logos can be included in publicly-available artifacts?

The [Third-party Trademark Usage Guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/policies/third-party-trademark-usage-guidelines/) cover the use of third-party trademarks in GitLab (the product), and set out the process for adding new third-party logos to GitLab.

[This advice](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/strategic-marketing/-/epics/321#note_558193816) covers the use of third-party trademarks in the context of comparative advertising.

#### Should our planning issues be confidential? And if so, should our Kickoff videos be private as well?

In general, keep the issues and videos public. For issues that are of possible interest to investors keep private until publicly disclosed. Don't make public videos that contain earnings and other material information prior to these details being publicly available.
Private issues that might find their way to an investor, analyst, or investment institution, are more likely to be in violation.

####  Should we avoid using $tag on Social Media posts?

`$cashtags` are commonly used to reference anything that is financially related to a company ([example](https://twitter.com/SoFi/status/1425911366313906177)). There is nothing wrong with using this symbol to reference or link to any financial information that has already been disclosed and distributed in an authorized public channel. For example, linking to a company's annual or quarterly statements published on their public website. 

If the information is not SAFE, do not link to it or share it publicly. 

####  Can you provide a definition for Information that is considered material?

Referencing the [SAFE](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/) handbook page is a great place to start. If you're still unsure, please reach out to Legal in [#legal](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C78E74A6L) and someone will be glad to assist you.
