## Section structure
The section is covered by groups from teams across two primary departments, Engineering and Product. Teams and team members from those departments have their own handbook pages linked below.

* Engineering
   * [Development](/engineering/development/)
      * [Configure & Monitor Sub-department](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/)
      * [CI/CD Sub-department](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/)
   * [UX](/handbook/engineering/ux/#team-structure)
      * [CI/CD UX](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/ci-cd/)
         * [Verify UX](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/verify/)
         * [Release UX](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/release/)
         * [Package UX](/handbook/engineering/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/package/)
      * Configure and Monitor UX
         * Configure UX (TBD)
         * Monitor UX (TBD)
   * [Quality](/handbook/engineering/quality/#quality-engineering-structure)
* Product
   * You can ping all Ops Section Product Managers in an issue using the `@gl-ops-section-pms` group.

## Investment Allocation
The [product groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups) within the Ops Section are outlined in the [product categories page](/handbook/product/product-categories/#ops-section).

The product department determines our [investment](/handbook/product/investment/) within the section by allocating headcount for development team members to product groups. While doing so we adhere to the following principles:
* All product groups will maintain at least a 1:1:1 ratio between three primary DRIs - Product Managers, Product Designers and Engineering Managers.
* We don't currently maintain 1:1:1:1 ratio for the additional Software Engineer in Test (SET) DRI but desire to have singular stable-counterparts between SETs and product groups.
* We will strive to maintain at least 6 developers (FE + BE) in each product group

## Meetings
