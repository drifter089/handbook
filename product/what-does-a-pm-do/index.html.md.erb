It has never been more [popular](https://medium.com/agileinsider/incredible-growth-in-demand-for-product-managers-in-the-us-but-not-necessarily-in-the-places-youd-936fec5c1932) to be a product manager, 
but the responsibilities of a product manager can vary greatly between organizations and even within an organization.

## The Main PM Responsibilities
As a product manager at GitLab, you are primarily responsible for:

1. What we build is solving a defined problem for our users and customers
1. What we build is loved by our users and customers
1. What we build is viable in GitLab's [open core business model](https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/)

### How does a PM ensure they are solving a problem for our users?

In order for a PM to truly understand the problems our users are facing, they must not only have a deep knowledge of their category's problem space but also be in regular communication with our users base. It is through user interactions that we can begin to understand what problems our users are facing and identify how we could make product improvements to help eliminate the pain points. These user interactions can present themselves in many different ways.

#### Interacting with our customers

**Regular Customer Calls**

As a PM, it's expected that you reach our to existing customers to check in regularly and understand how they are utilizing GitLab's existing features. These calls offer a unique opportunity to better understand our customer's use-cases, and further our understanding of our our product and features play a direct role in their daily work. These calls also offer a great opportunity to discuss what is working well for them, and what ares are still painful. Identifying these pain points across multiple customers can start to help us form an understanding on areas where we can improve.

**Pre-sales / sales calls **

Some of our most constructive criticism comes from perspective customers who are considering switching to GitLab from one or many other tools. Working closely with our Technical Account Managers (TAMs) and Solution Architects (SAs) during proof of concept (POC) and proof of value (POV) opportunities provides valuable insight into where we may have new opportunities for solving customer problems.

Talking to those opportunities who may not choose our solution is extremely valuable as it gives a much different perspective of our product capabilities than talking to existing users.

**UX Research**

Collaborating with our UX Research team members to perform research into specific interactions will help us make our features easier to discover, and easier to use. These research opportunities can provide valuable feedback which can assist us in making key strategic decisions in product direction.

#### Making sense of the data

Customer conversations will identify all sorts of problems.
