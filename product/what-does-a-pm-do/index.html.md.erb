It has never been more [popular](https://medium.com/agileinsider/incredible-growth-in-demand-for-product-managers-in-the-us-but-not-necessarily-in-the-places-youd-936fec5c1932) to be a product manager, 
but the responsibilities of a product manager can vary greatly between organizations and even within an organization.

## The Main PM Responsibilities
As a product manager at GitLab, you are primarily responsible for:

1. What we build is solving a defined problem for our users and customers
1. What we build is loved by our users and customers
1. What we build is viable in GitLab's [open core business model](https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/)

### How does a PM ensure they are solving a problem for our users?

In order for a PM to truly understand the problems our users are facing, they must not only have a deep knowledge of their category's problem space but also be in regular communicatio with our users. It is mainly through user interactions where these problems are discussed. These interactions consist of:

- Customer interviews - discussing specific use cases of our features, and asking our customers where their pain points lie
- Pre-sales / sales calls - working with our Techincal Account Managers (TAMs) and Solution Architects (SAs) during proof of concept (POC) and proof of value (POV) opportunities
- UX Research - collaborating with our UX Research team members to perform research into specific interactions

These conversations will yeild a variety of problems. Collating this data, it's possible to start forming user stories and jobs to be done (JTBD).
