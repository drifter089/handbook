## Recommended books

There are three recommended books to be read by every product manager at GitLab:

- **[Marty Cagan: Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers-ebook/dp/B077NRB36N)** Provides a generic overview about Product Management
- **[Melissa Perry: Escaping the Build Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/dp/149197379X/)** Describes how to build and operate a successful product team

Other books are shared below as relevant to specific product management skills. Each skill below  might include multiple competencies. For each skill or competency we've tried to find a single introductory level content, a detailed book and an online course to allow every PM to improve. The introductory contents should be accessible either freely or freely for GitLab Team members, the books and online courses [can be reimbursed following the GitLab reimbursement policies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#work-related-online-courses-and-professional-development-certifications).
