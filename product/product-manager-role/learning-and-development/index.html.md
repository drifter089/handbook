Welcome to Learning and Development for Product Management at GitLab! Here you'll find resources to help you, probably a product manager, explore, learn and grow in the competencies we track in our [career development framework](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/#product-management-career-development-framework). The content here spans various skill levels and is recommended to help every product manager have a successful journey at GitLab and in their product career as a whole. The content should be accessible at no cost but anything requiring payment [can be reimbursed following the GitLab reimbursement policies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#work-related-online-courses-and-professional-development-certifications).

We have organised the content on this page by Product Management competencies. There are short introductory materials for each competency, and in-depth content to provide a deep understanding and application of a topic. We understand that the evolving Product Management space requires continuous learning, and GitLab is determined to provide the time needed for in-depth learning too as part of your working time.
