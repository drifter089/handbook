Welcome to Learning and Development for Product Management at GitLab! This page serves as the content library that feeds [GitLab Learn for Product Management](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/gitlab-product-team-learning-hub). You are welcome to explore content here but if you prefer a more modular, personalizable, and trackable portal, please visit GitLab Learn. This page, together with GitLab Learn for Product Management is what we consider and refer to as GitLab's "Product L & D Hub". 

The resources in the Product L & D Hub are meant to support product managers to explore, learn and grow at their own pace. We aim to collect content that spans various skill levels, as well as various levels of depth/commitment. It is recommended that product managers engage with the resources here to help them have a successful journey at GitLab and in their product career as a whole. 

Most of the resources here are free but any content requiring payment [can be reimbursed following the GitLab reimbursement policies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#work-related-online-courses-and-professional-development-certifications).

Over time, we will add content to directly support GitLab's product management [competencies](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/product-CDF-competencies/), [CDF](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/product-CDF-competencies/) and [product development flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/). We understand that the evolving product management space requires continuous learning, and GitLab is committed to providing the time needed for in-depth learning too as part of your working time. You are encouraged to ask your manager to help you carve out time for Learning and Development.

##### New Manager Buddy Program

- For new Group Managers at GitLab, we have an buddy program that matches the new Group Manager with a Senior leader (Director or above) in the Product team that is not in their direct reporting chain. This is an optional program to help new managers understand GitLab management process, find a sounding board to discuss challenging situations in a safe space without judgement, and generally learn management techniques. Although this is targeted to new managers (typically first time managers), it is open to those who are becoming a manager for the first time at GitLab but have been managers elsewhere.

# How to contribute to the Product L & D Hub

Keeping our Product L & D Hub robust and relevant is a team effort. We encourage to you to contribute as you come across resources that are helpful to you. And if there are resources in the Product L & D Hub that are outdated or you disagree with, we encourage you to bring it to our attention as well.

There are two components to the Product L & D hub:

1. [GitLab Learn for Product Management](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/gitlab-product-team-learning-hub), which is a  more modular, personalizable, and trackable portal
1. This page, which serves as the required content library that feeds GitLab Learn for Product Management

In order to add content to  [GitLab Learn for Product Management](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/gitlab-product-team-learning-hub), the content must first be added to and exist on this page. Then, the content is added to GitLab Learn by [learning evangelists and curators](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-learn/contribute/team-member-contributions/#contributing-to-gitlab-learn-as-a-team-member). 

If there‚Äôs content you want to add to or remove from this library, simply raise an MR and add any of the [product learning evangelists](#product-learning-evangelists) listed below as `Reviewer`. Tell us in the MR whether you're recommending the resources for just the library or if you'd like to see it added to GitLab Learn for Product Management as well. Details explaining what you value about the content and how you think it's helpful should be added to the description of the MR. Please add `milestone` and labels `product operations` `product handbook` and `prodops:release` to the MR.
