## Product Leadership

The separate page [Product Leadership](/handbook/product/product-leadership/) covers how to be an effective leader in the product management organization.

## Product Organizational Structure

The GitLab Product team includes team members at various levels of [Product Management job titles](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/#product-management-career-development-framework) across our [organizational levels](/company/team/structure/#levels) with scope at various points in our [product hierarchy](/handbook/product/product-categories/#hierarchy). As a result there can be instances where peers across layers don't have the same title. We will always abide by [GitLab's layer structure](/company/team/structure/#layers).

## How to work as a PM

If you follow the [Product Principles](/handbook/product/product-principles) and [Product Processes](/handbook/product/product-processes) in our handbook, you won't be writing long, detailed
specs for a part of the product for next year. So how should you be spending your time?

Invest the majority of your time (say 70%) in deeply understanding the problem.
Then spend 10% of your time writing the spec _for the first iteration only_ and
handling comments, and use the remaining 20% to work on promoting it.

A problem you understand well should always have a (seemingly) simple or obvious
solution. Reduce it to its simplest form and only ship that as an [MVC](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc).

Once you've shipped your solution, both you and the community will
have a much better idea of what can be improved and what should be prioritized
for future iterations.

As a PM, you're the person that has to kick-off new initiatives. You're not
responsible for shipping something on time, but you _are_ responsible for taking
action and setting the direction. Be active everywhere, over-communicate, and
sell the things you think are important to the rest of the team and community.

As a PM, you need to set the bar for engineering. That is, to push engineering and
the rest of the company. You almost want engineering to complain about the pace
that product is setting. Our default instinct will be to slow down, but we can't
give in to that.

As a PM you don't own the product; ask other people for feedback and give
team members and the community the space to suggest and create things without your
direct intervention. It's your job to make sure things are decided and
planned, not come up with every idea or change.

### Where should you look when you need help?

- The first thing you should do is read this page carefully, as well as the
[general handbook](/handbook/).
- You can ask questions related to Product in the `#product` Slack channel.
- General questions should be asked in `#questions`.
- Specific Git related questions should be asked in `#git-help`.
- HR questions should be asked in `#peopleops`.

### Responsibilities and Expectations

The responsibilities for [Product Managers, Sr. Product Managers, and Principal Product Managers](/job-families/product/product-manager/), [Group Manager, Product Management](/job-families/product/group-manager-product/)
[Director of Product](/job-families/product/director-of-product/),
[VP of Product](/job-families/product/vp-of-product/) and
[VP of Product Strategy](/job-families/product/vp-of-product-strategy/) are outlined in our job families pages.

The progression of responsibilities allocation between tactical, operational and strategic
is well illustrated by this helpful chart.

![GitLab PM Responsibility Allocation Chart](/handbook/product/pm-allocation.png)

_[Source File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19gAgPJVdXfBpXiFOlT1WqZLJB_eFU7W7slmAzodEuDM/edit#gid=1012729771). Note - Thanks to [Melissa Perri](https://twitter.com/lissijean/) for the inspiration_

In addition, as a Product Manager you're expected to:

- Use the product and deeply understand the features you're responsible for.
- Follow the issues you've been involved with / are assigned to as a PM. That
includes reading all comments. Use email notifications for this.
- Make sure the issue description and title is updated when necessary. It
should always reflect the current state of the issue.
- Make sure issues are moved forward when needed. You should not only avoid
being the bottleneck, you should also be the person moving issues forward when
they get stuck or overlooked.
- Make sure features solve the original problem effectively.
- Make sure features are complete: documentation, marketing, API, etc.
- Know when to cut corners and when not to. If we merge documentation a day
later, that's usually acceptable. Conversely though, learning from a customer
that documentation is lacking is not.
- Excite and market new features and changes internally and externally.
- Help build a plan and strategy for GitLab and GitLab's features.
- Understand deeply whatever it is you're working on. You should be spending a
lot of time learning about your subject matter.
- Have regular meetings (at least once a week) with customers.
- Make sure marketing materials related to your work are up to date.
- Ensure that `data/categories.yml` is up to date, including accurate links based on the defined link [hierarchy](/handbook/product/product-categories/).

Occasionally, Product Managers are asked to perform the role of "Life Support" Product Manager for
a group. When doing so please refer to the [Life Support PM expectations](#life-support-pm-expectations).

As we grow, Product Managers can be listed across multiple stages and be asked to
perform the role of Product Manager across split or multiple teams in an "Interim" basis. While
temporary and based on future hiring, these positions are not considered
"Life Support" and thus the standard Responsibilities and Expectations apply.

### Scope of responsibilities

The product team is responsible for iteration on most of GitLab's products and
projects:

- GitLab CE and EE
- GitLab.com
- about.gitlab.com
- customers.gitlab.com
- version.gitlab.com
- license.gitlab.com

This includes the entire stack and all its facets. The product team needs to
weigh and prioritize not only bugs, features, regressions, performance, but also
architectural changes and other changes required for ensuring GitLab's excellence

### Direction

Our product wide, section, stage and category direction pages can be found from our [Direction](/direction) page.

As this document and the [direction page](/direction) shows,
there are a million things we want to do.
So, how do we prioritize them and schedule things properly?
A [product group](/company/team/structure/#product-groups)'s [PM is the DRI for prioritization](#pm-em-ux-and-qe-quad-dris) and per our DRI definition they do not [owe an explanation for their decisions](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#empowering-dris-no-explanation-needed) because we don't want PMs to fall into a perpetual loop of explaining and prefer a [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action). However, [one responsibility of a PM](/job-families/product/product-manager/#responsibilities) is to build rapport and align your stakeholders on priorities. It's almost always in a PMs best interest to explain why they are making prioritization calls.

### Important dates PMs should keep in mind

### CDF Reviews

Product Management Leadership will perform CDF reviews with their team members on a regular cadence; the suggested cadence is every 2-3 months. Consider creating a recurring meeting dedicated to this topic rather than utilizing existing 1:1 meetings.

## Competencies

Product Managers must be able to demonstrate a variety of skills across our CDF. We provide additional career development guidance by listing priority [competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/) for each CDF category.

At the moment we are working building out our Product Management Competencies.

### Validation Track Competencies

The [validation track](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-track) is the first phase of GitLab's Product Development Workflow. Industry wide, this track is commonly referred to as ideation and research. This phase lays the foundation for designs and solutions. When the business and users problems are well understood, the more likely it is that the product will solve the user's problem and the higher likelihood that those users will enjoy the solution.

Using a competencies model will help Product Managers understand the expectations of the validation track at each level in the Product Management organization. The competencies in the validation track are:

1. Customer Interviewing
1. Creating an Opportunity Canvas
1. Creating a Storyboard Designing Prototypes
1. Engaging Analysts via Inquiries

#### Customer Interviewing Competency

Customer interviewing is essential to clearly defining the user's needs, problems, and jobs to be done. At GitLab, customer interviewing is typically done in partnership with User Experience, including Product Design and User Research. This competency will help Product Managers get stronger at problem identification and curating a solid foundation for user stories, prototypes and solutions to be built upon.

### Business Competencies
Product Managers are responsible for driving the success for a product area. To do so effectively requires a nuanced understanding of the market dynamics. It also requires the ability to organize, influence, and iterate to reach the desired outcomes.

#### Understanding Buyer Based Tiering
GitLab has an [Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model) business model and generate the majority of revenue from [paid tiers](/pricing/). While general pricing decisions are made by the CEO, [determining pricing tier for product features](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#departments) is an important aspect of the Product Manager's job. We use a [buyer based tiering](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#buyer-based-tiering-clarification) model to determine which of the [four tiers](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#four-tiers) a feature belongs to. Being able to clearly define and articulate pricing decisions and strategy is a critical competency for PMs to master in order to influence the success of GitLab's business.

|  **Level** | **Demonstrates Competency by...**| **Assessment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|**PM**| Product Managers are the pricing expert for their respective groups. They understand the GitLab business model and can explain why GitLab is [sold as a suite](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#only-sell-a-suite). They lead the group to fulfill GitLab's [stewardship promise](/company/stewardship/#promises). Product managers are dept at applying [buyer based tiering](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#buyer-based-open-core) when determining pricing tiers. When necessary, PMs lead their group to [quickly move features down tiers](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#if-a-feature-can-be-moved-down-do-it-quickly). For their specific stages and categories, the PMs are active in learning the buyer personas and common go-to-market motions so that they can prioritize the right features in line with GitLab's [pricing philosophy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#pricing-philosophy). | TBD |
|**Sr. PM**| Senior Product Managers are skilled at applying buyer based tiering when determining the pricing tier for a feature. They think holistically and leverage [capabilities](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#capabilities) to drive adoption for their features in paying tiers. Senior PMs build logical ramps to enable customers to move up in tier by prioritizing features valued by [advocates and champions](/handbook/sales/sales-operating-procedures/facilitate-the-opportunity/#312-finding-your-champions). They are also familiar with the buyer personas and go-to-market motions in relevant stages and categories and can identify and lead their group to find the right balance between [revenue, cost, and value](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#when-is-a-dollar-not-a-dollar) for GitLab and its customers. Lastly, senior PMs provide guidance and coaching to team members and fellow Product Managers to help drive consistency in tiering strategy. | TBD |
|**Principal PM/ Group Manager PM**| Highly skilled at applying buyer based tiering when making pricing decisions. Understands deeply the buyer persona and go-to-market motion in relevant stages or categories and is able to identify and articulate key needs for each buyer tier. Collaborates with pricing manager and product leadership to ensure alignment across GitLab. | TBD |
|**Director PM**| Ensures consistent application of buyer based tiering across product groups. Coaches Product Managers on market specific buyer needs and go-to-market strategy. Drives GitLab wide pricing changes. | TBD |


### Communication Competencies

[Product Managers communicate](/handbook/product/product-processes/#communication) to various audiences across an array of medium. As a result the set of communication competencies for Product Managers is more diverse than those for other positions.

#### Writing to Inspire Action Competency

[Writing to inspire action](/handbook/product/product-processes/#writing-to-inspire-action) is a critical competency for PMs in order to facilitate a bias towards action within their [Product Groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups). PMs communicate with a wide variety of audiences one key to inspiring action via your writing is focusing on what your reader values.

### Build Track Competencies
The [build track](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-track) is the second phase of GitLab's Product Development Workflow. This track is the execution phase for the solutions that were validated and designed during the Validation track.

Using a competencies model will help Product Managers understand the expectations of the build track at each level in the Product Management organization. The competencies in the build track are:

1. Breaking Down Your Issues
1. Optimizing PM Inputs for Development Outputs
1. Understanding GitLab Architecture
1. Demoing GitLab

#### Breaking Down Issues
The ability to break down larger features and functionality into small iterative issues is a key skill of any Product Manager. Breaking down issues into small iterations enables the development team to quickly understand what is the next most important iteration to execute.  To be skilled in this competency, a Product Manager must have a deep understanding of the customer problem to be solved, a strong familiarity with how GitLab is architected, and familiar with how software applications function.

|  **Level** | **Demonstrates Competency by...**| **Assessment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PM** | Adept at breaking solutions down into issues for development. Learning the [iteration strategies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#iteration-strategies) outlined in the [Product Development Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/) and implementing them in collaboration with their Engineering Manager. Active in their pursuit to understand underlying GitLab's [technical architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html) to aid in their ability to make iterations as small as possible. Seeks feedback from their Engineering Manager, their team, and other Product Managers on issues during the planning process to make sure that they are considering the different ways that issues can be broken down and working to [lower their level of shame](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame)|TBD|
| **Sr. PM** |Skilled at breaking solutions down into issues for development. Regularly practices all [iteration strategies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#iteration-strategies) outlined in the [Product Development Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/) without direct support from their engineering manager. Proactively requests reviews from Engineering to make sure that issues have been broken down and refined early in the [planning cycle](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-phase-1-plan). Familiar with GitLabâ€™s underlying [technical architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html) and is able to leverage that knowledge when breaking down issues. |TBD|
| **Principal PM/ Group Manager PM** |Highly skilled at breaking solutions down into issues for development. All proposed Issues are [MVCs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#minimal-viable-change-mvc) and logically broken down based on the [iteration strategies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#iteration-strategies) outlined in the [Product Development Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/).

### Product Manager Onboarding

Product Manager onboarding, beyond any [product specific steps in your first week onboarding ticket](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/employment/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_tasks/department_product_management.md),
is defined in the Product projects [PM Onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/PM-onboarding.md).

Onboarding issues can be tracked in the [Product Onboarding Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/boards/1283554?&label_name%5B%5D=onboarding).

Iteration on Product Management Onboarding is encouraged by all team members. To do so, create an MR against one of the above files and assign it to your manager for review and merge.

## Interviewing Product Management Candidates

A unique and important step in the interview process for Product Management candidates is our Deep Dive Interview. The goal of this interview is to understand the candidate's ability to communicate a long term vision as well as a short term MVC, both verbally during the interview itself, and written via two follow up issues. Once the issues are ready for you to read, it is an opportunity to provide feedback and see how the candidate responds to that feedback.

You can find more information and instructions on the Deep Dive interview [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/hiring-processes/blob/master/Product/DeepDive.md). For information on our hiring process, head over to our [hiring handbook pages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/). |
