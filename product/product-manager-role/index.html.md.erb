## Product Organizational Structure

The GitLab Product team includes team members at various levels of [Product Management job titles](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/#product-management-career-development-framework) across our [organizational levels](/company/team/structure/#levels) with scope at various points in our [product hierarchy](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy). As a result there can be instances where peers across layers don't have the same title. We will always abide by [GitLab's layer structure](/company/team/structure/#layers).

## How to work as a PM

If you follow the [Product Principles](/handbook/product/product-principles) and [Product Processes](/handbook/product/product-processes) in our handbook, you won't be writing long, detailed
specs for a part of the product for next year. So how should you be spending your time?

Invest the majority of your time (say 70%) in deeply understanding the problem.
Then spend 10% of your time writing the spec _for the first iteration only_ and
handling comments, and use the remaining 20% to work on promoting it.

A problem you understand well should always have a (seemingly) simple or obvious
solution. Reduce it to its simplest form (see above) and only ship that.

Once you've shipped your solution, both you and the community will
have a much better idea of what can be improved and what should be prioritized
for future iterations.

As a PM, you're the person that has to kick-off new initiatives. You're not
responsible for shipping something on time, but you _are_ responsible for taking
action and setting the direction. Be active everywhere, over-communicate, and
sell the things you think are important to the rest of the team and community.

As a PM, you need to set the bar for engineering. That is, to push engineering and
the rest of the company. You almost want engineering to complain about the pace
that product is setting. Our default instinct will be to slow down, but we can't
give in to that.

As a PM you don't own the product; ask other people for feedback and give
team members and the community the space to suggest and create things without your
direct intervention. It's your job to make sure things are decided and
planned, not come up with every idea or change.

### Where should you look when you need help?

* The first thing you should do is read this page carefully, as well as the
[general handbook](/handbook/).
* You can ask questions related to Product in the `#product` Slack channel.
* General questions should be asked in `#questions`.
* Specific Git related questions should be asked in `#git-help`.
* HR questions should be asked in `#peopleops`.

### Responsibilities and Expectations

The responsibilities for [Product Managers, Sr. Product Managers, and Principal Product Managers](/job-families/product/product-manager/), [Group Manager, Product Management](/job-families/product/group-manager-product/)
[Director of Product](/job-families/product/director-of-product/),
[VP of Product](/job-families/product/vp-of-product/) and
[VP of Product Strategy](/job-families/product/vp-of-product-strategy/) are outlined in our job families pages.

The progression of responsibilities allocation between tactical, operational and strategic
is well illustrated by this helpful chart.

In addition, as a Product Manager you're expected to:

- Use the product and deeply understand the features you're responsible for.
- Follow the issues you've been involved with / are assigned to as a PM. That
  includes reading all comments. Use email notifications for this.
- Make sure the issue description and title is updated when necessary. It
  should always reflect the current state of the issue.
- Make sure issues are moved forward when needed. You should not only avoid
  being the bottleneck, you should also be the person moving issues forward when
  they get stuck or overlooked.
- Make sure features solve the original problem effectively.
- Make sure features are complete: documentation, marketing, API, etc.
- Know when to cut corners and when not to. If we merge documentation a day
  later, that's usually acceptable. Conversely though, learning from a customer
  that documentation is lacking is not.
- Excite and market new features and changes internally and externally.
- Help build a plan and strategy for GitLab and GitLab's features.
- Understand deeply whatever it is you're working on. You should be spending a
  lot of time learning about your subject matter.
- Have regular meetings (at least once a week) with customers.
- Make sure marketing materials related to your work are up to date.
- Ensure that `data/categories.yml` is up to date, including accurate links based on the defined link [hierarchy](/handbook/product/product-categories/).

Occasionally, Product Managers are asked to perform the role of "Life Support" Product Manager for
a group. When doing so please refer to the [Life Support PM expectations](#life-support-pm-expectations).

As we grow, Product Managers can be listed across multiple stages and be asked to
perform the role of Product Manager across split or multiple teams in an "Interim" basis. While
temporary and based on future hiring, these positions are not considered
"Life Support" and thus the standard Responsibilities and Expectations apply.

### Scope of responsibilities

The product team is responsible for iteration on most of GitLab's products and
projects:

- GitLab CE and EE
- GitLab.com
- about.gitlab.com
- customers.gitlab.com
- version.gitlab.com
- license.gitlab.com

This includes the entire stack and all its facets. The product team needs to
weigh and prioritize not only bugs, features, regressions, performance, but also
architectural changes and other changes required for ensuring GitLab's excellence.

### Prioritization

### Direction
Our product wide, section, stage and category direction pages can be found from our [Direction](/direction) page.

As this document and the [direction page](/direction) shows,
there are a million things we want to do.
So, how do we prioritize them and schedule things properly?
A [product group](/company/team/structure/#product-groups)'s [PM is the DRI for prioritization](#pm-em-ux-and-qe-quad-dris) and per our DRI definition they do not [owe an explanation for their decisions](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#empowering-dris-no-explanation-needed) because we don't want PMs to fall into a perpetual loop of explaining and prefer a [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action). However, [one responsibility of a PM](/job-families/product/product-manager/#responsibilities) is to build rapport and align your stakeholders on priorities. It's almost always in a PMs best interest to explain why they are making prioritization calls.

### Product Manager Onboarding

Product Manager onboarding, beyond any [product specific steps in your first week onboarding ticket](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/employment/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_tasks/department_product_management.md),
is defined in the Product projects [PM Onboarding issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/PM-onboarding.md).

Onboarding issues can be tracked in the [Product Onboarding Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/boards/1283554?&label_name[]=onboarding).

Iteration on Product Management Onboarding is encouraged by all team members. To do so, create an MR against one of the above files and assign it to your manager for review and merge.

### Important dates PMs should keep in mind

See [Product Development Timeline](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline).

## Product Management Career Development Framework
<kbd class="required">Required ðŸ”Ž</kbd>

We track our progress through the skills required to be a product manager at all levels via the Product Management Career Development Framework (CDF). The single source of truth for that framework is the table below but you can use this [GoogleSheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NaqSgu_1IcL_DYRHjrDGsKLooSykpewD3QYU2OZR5jc/edit#gid=1091464991) to track your career development with your manager.

### CDF Reviews
Product Management Leadership will perform CDF reviews with their team members on a regular cadence; the suggested cadence is every 2-3 months. Consider creating a recurring meeting dedicated to this topic rather than utilizing existing 1:1 meetings.

## Interviewing Product Management Candidates

A unique and important step in the interview process for Product Management candidates is our Deep Dive Interview. The goal of this interview is to understand the candidate's ability to communicate a long term vision as well as a short term MVC, both verbally during the interview itself, and written via two follow up issues. Once the issues are ready for you to read, it is an opportunity to provide feedback and see how the candidate responds to that feedback.

You can find more information and instructions on the Deep Dive interview [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/hiring-processes/blob/master/Product/DeepDive.md). For information on our hiring process, head over to our [hiring handbook pages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/).                                                                                                        |
