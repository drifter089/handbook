## Legal Overview

Below you'll find Legal guidance for the product managers to further clarify and expand on the [Regulation FD Training](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/ECL-22b23314-fc04-4728-9ae6-a363d3a39c54)].   

## General Guidelines

GitLab's legal department has put together a comprehensive framework to help team members determine which information is internal only and that which can be shared publicly. By following the [SAFE framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/), you will naturally comply with Regulation Fair Disclosure policies. 

### If you're not sure 

Please reach out to Legal in #legal within Slack and someone will be glad to assist you. 

###  Required Disclaimers

### Frequently Asked Questions


#### Requesting a review from legal 

If you need a review from legal, please ping `@Rashmi` or `@Heidi Loeffert` in `#legal`. Turnaround time is a minimum of 48 hours.

#### What artifacts/actions can generally be published with a disclaimer? 

See the table above. 

#### What limitations do we have on sharing specific instrumentation data in public issues?

None so long as the instrumentation data does not contain [sensitive](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#sensitive), [financial](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#financial), or [internal-only](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#internal) data.

#### How do we determine the permission process for fair use of diagrams or processes such as SAFe?

Legal is currently working on formal guidelines. They will be linked here as soon as they are ready. 

#### What type of competitor or integration names or logos can we include?

[Third-party Trademark Usage Guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/policies/third-party-trademark-usage-guidelines/) - this considers the use of third-party trademarks in GitLab (the product), and sets out the process for adding new third-party logos to GitLab.

[This advice](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/strategic-marketing/-/epics/321#note_558193816) covers use of third-party trademarks in the context of comparative advertising.

#### Should our planning issues be confidential? Any if so, should our Kickoff videos be Private as well?

In general, keep the issues and videos public. For issues that are of possible interest to investors keep private until publicly disclosed. Don't make public videos that contain earnings and other material information prior to these details being publicly available.
Private Issues that might find its way to an investor, analyst, or Investment institution, are more likely to be in violation.
