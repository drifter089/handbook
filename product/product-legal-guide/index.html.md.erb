## Legal Overview

This guide for GitLab Product Managers clarifies and expands on the [Regulation FD Training](https://gitlab.edcast.com/pathways/ECL-22b23314-fc04-4728-9ae6-a363d3a39c54).   

## General Guidelines

GitLab Legal has put together a comprehensive framework to help team members determine which information is internal only and that which can be shared publicly. By following the [SAFE framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/), you will naturally comply with Regulation Fair Disclosure policies. 

### If you're not sure 

Please reach out to Legal in [#legal](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C78E74A6L) and someone will be glad to assist you.

### Frequently Asked Questions


#### Requesting a review from legal 

If you need a review from Legal, please ping `@Rashmi` or `@Heidi Loeffert` in [#legal](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C78E74A6L). Turnaround time is a minimum of 48 hours.

#### What artifacts/actions can generally be published with a disclaimer? 

See the table above. 

#### What limitations do we have on sharing specific instrumentation data in public issues?

None, so long as the instrumentation data does not contain [sensitive](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#sensitive), [financial](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/#financial), or [internal-only](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#internal) data.

#### What third-party materials (like images, diagrams, and quotes) can be included in publicly-available artifacts?

Guidelines covering the use of third-aprty materials are being prepared and will be linked here when ready. 

#### What third-party company and product names and logos can be included in publicly-available artifacts?

The [Third-party Trademark Usage Guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/policies/third-party-trademark-usage-guidelines/) cover the use of third-party trademarks in GitLab (the product), and set out the process for adding new third-party logos to GitLab.

[This advice](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/strategic-marketing/-/epics/321#note_558193816) covers the use of third-party trademarks in the context of comparative advertising.

#### Should our planning issues be confidential? And if so, should our Kickoff videos be private as well?

In general, keep the issues and videos public. For issues that are of possible interest to investors keep private until publicly disclosed. Don't make public videos that contain earnings and other material information prior to these details being publicly available.
Private issues that might find their way to an investor, analyst, or investment institution, are more likely to be in violation.
