## How to make pricing and tier decisions

Product managers are responsible for helping to determine and maintain the optimal tier for their features.  To accomplish this, the following resources should be leveraged for an understanding of GitLab's pricing model and supporting resources:

### Pricing model

GitLab leverages a buyer-based *open core* pricing model. Product managers should fully understand the strategy, philosophy and various components of [GitLab's pricing model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#pricing-strategy) and engage with product leaders regarding any aspect that is unclear to them. 

### Relevant personas

It can be challenging to find a the balance between users' needs and buyers' decision drivers. Product managers should frequently engage with the walk through of GitLab's [tiers and personas](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#four-tiers) to remain knowledgable on which *buyer* personas are most relevant to each tier and why.

### Reasons for upgrade

Multiple considerations go into customers' purchase decisions. Here are some various resources product managers can visit to reference various data points for analysis:

- [Post purchase surveys](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/product-operations/#post-purchase)

## How to consider impact to revenue

### Driving revenue 

Our [stewardship principles](https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/) determine if something belongs in a paid tier. The likely buyer determines which tier.

 Here are some helpful examples: 

- [Create stage's use of popularity to drive revenue](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#pricing)
- [Plan stage's balance between usage and enterprise adoption](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/#plan-stage-pricing-strategy)
- [Enablement section's balance of ease of use and scale](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/enablement/#pricing)

### Learning opportunities
 
Pricing adjustments within a buyer-based model can be difficult and sometimes feel anti-intuitive. Below are some examples of strategies/tactics that have succeeded and failed that we can learn from:
