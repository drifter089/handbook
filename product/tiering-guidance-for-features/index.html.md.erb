## How to make pricing and tier decisions

Product managers are responsible for helping to determine and maintain the optimal tier for their features.  To accomplish this, product managers should levearge the supprting resources below to understand and implement the strategy, philosophy and various components of GitLab's pricing model. If any asepct is unclear to and engage with product leaders regarding any aspect that is unclear, product managers should not hestiste to connect with their manager for discussion and clarificaition. 


### Paid Tiers

The [CEO is the DRI for pricing and tiers](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#departments). This includes any changes that directly impacts how we charge customers under our licensing model, such as a [change to how we handle active users](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/22257). GitLab leverages a buyer-based *open core* pricing model. Please review the entirety of the [stewardship](/company/stewardship/) and [pricing model](/handbook/ceo/pricing/) pages before making any determinations of which tier a given feature should go in.

#### What goes in what paid tier

Our [stewardship principles](/company/stewardship/) determine whether something belongs in a
paid tier. The [likely buyer](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#buyer-based-open-core) determines which tier.

#### Determining the tier of a new feature

When making a decision on the tier for a new feature, please refer to the [pricing page](/handbook/ceo/pricing/) for guidance. Be sure to consider
documenting your rationale for the decision in the issue description, including a reference to our [stewardship page](/company/stewardship/) when appropriate.

Please indicate the applicable tier for an issue by applying the label associated with the tier (e.g. `GitLab Core`, `GitLab Starter`) and the
`Enterprise Edition` label for features targeting a paid tier. Ensure this is defined before feature development begins.

#### Bringing features to lower tiers and pricing changes

To propose bringing a feature to a lower tier or making a change that impacts how we charge customers, please follow the process on the [CEO pricing page](/handbook/ceo/pricing/#bringing-features-to-lower-tiers-and-pricing-changes).

To ensure colloaboration and alignment with key GitLab stakeholders, please leverage the pricing changes template  https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#changing-tiers-and-pricing-changes

#### Paid Tier requirements

All Starter, Premium, and Ultimate features must:

- Work easily for our customers that self-host GitLab. i.e. Their
licenses need not be updated and the new feature is default-on for the
instance.
- Work with GitLab.com Bronze / Silver / Gold subscriptions. This means there has to be
some way of toggling or using the feature at a namespace level.
- Have documentation.
- Be featured on [products](/product/) and [DevOps tools](/devops-tools) at launch.

### Relevant personas

It can be challenging to find a the balance between users' needs and buyers' decision drivers. Product managers should frequently engage with the walk through of GitLab's [tiers and personas](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/pricing/#four-tiers) to remain knowledgable on which *buyer* personas are most relevant to each tier and why.

### Reasons for upgrade

Multiple considerations go into customers' purchase decisions. Here are some various resources product managers can visit to reference various data points for analysis:

- [Post purchase surveys](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/product-operations/#post-purchase)

## How to consider impact to revenue

### Driving revenue 

Our [stewardship principles](https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/) determine if something belongs in a paid tier. The likely buyer determines which tier.

 Here are some helpful examples: 

- [Create stage's use of popularity to drive revenue](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/#pricing)
- [Plan stage's balance between usage and enterprise adoption](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/#plan-stage-pricing-strategy)
- [Enablement section's balance of ease of use and scale](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/enablement/#pricing)

### Learning opportunities
 
Pricing adjustments within a buyer-based model can be difficult and sometimes feel anti-intuitive. Below are some examples of strategies/tactics that have succeeded and failed that we can learn from:
