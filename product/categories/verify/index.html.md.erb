### Intent of this page 

The Verify Product Group wants to increase [sharing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#share), [findability](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#findability), and encourage [bias for async communication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication). We will use this handbookpage as forum for showcasing our team processes while also providing an opportunity to encourage a open discussion between teammembers on our processes for retrospective.
