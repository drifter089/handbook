### Opportunity Canvas

One of the primary artifacts of the validation track is the Opportunity Canvas. The Opportunity Canvas introduces a lean product management philosophy to the validation track by quickly iterating on level of confidence, hypotheses, and lessons learned as the document evolves.  At completion, it serves as a concise set of knowledge which can be transferred to the relevant issues and epics to aid in understanding user pain, business value, and the constraints to a particular problem statement. Just as valuable as a completed Opportunity Canvas is an incomplete one. The tool is also useful for quickly invalidating ideas. A quickly invalidated problem is often **more valuable** than a slowly validated one.

Please note that an opportunity canvas is not required for product functionality or problems that already have well-defined [jobs to be done (JTBD)](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-resources/#jobs-to-be-done-jtbd). For situations where we already have a strong understanding of the problem and its solution, it is appropriate to skip the opportunity canvas and proceed directly to solution validation. It might be worth using the opportunity canvas template for existing features in the product to test assumptions and current thinking, although not required.

#### Opportunity Canvas Lite 

Opportunity Canvases are a great assessment for ill-defined or poorly understood problems our customers are experiencing that may result in net new features. As noted previously, opportunity canvases may be helpful for existing features, which is where the [`Product-Opportunity-Opportunity-Canvas-Lite`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Product-Opportunity-Canvas-Lite.md) issue template delivers. This template offers a lightweight approach to quickly identify the customer problem, business case, and feature plan in a convenient issue. The steps to use the template are outlined in the [Instructions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Product-Opportunity-Canvas-Lite.md#instructions) section and for clarity one would create this issue template for an existing feature they are interested in expanding. For example, this template would be great to use if you are evaluating the opportunity to add a third or fourth iteration to an MVC. This issue should leverage already available resources and be used to collate details to then surface to leadership for review. Once you fill out the template, you will assign to the parties identifed in the issue and you can always post in the `#product` channel for visibility.
