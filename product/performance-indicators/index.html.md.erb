## Structure

In order to provide a useful single metric for [product groups](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#product-groups) which maps well to a product-wide Key Performance indicators, some product performance indicators cascade upwards. Here is how:

* [Action Monthly Active Users (AMAU)](#action-monthly-active-users-amau) - Are the building blocks, these are unique users performing a certain action. _For example_ - unique users interacting with a [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/operations/feature_flags.html)
* [Group Monthly Active Users (GMAU)](#group-monthly-active-users-gmau) - Are used for targetting the R&D efforts of [Product Groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups). These are the union of unique users from the group's AMAUs. _For example_ - In the [Progressive Delivery group](/handbook/product/product-categories/#progressive-delivery-group), the union of unique users interacting with [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/operations/feature_flags.html) and [review apps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/).
* [Stage Monthly Active users (SMAU)](#stage-monthly-active-users-smau) - Are used, in part, for targetting [R&D investments](/handbook/product/investment/#investment-by-stage) across multiple stages. These are the union of unique users from the relevant GMAU's plus any stage level AMAU's that might not fall cleanly into a GMAU. _For example_ - In the [Release stage](/handbook/product/product-categories/#release-stage), the union of Release:Progressive Delivery and Release:Release Management GMAU's plus unique users creating pipelines which perform a deployment.
* [Total Monthly Active Users (TMAU)](#total-monthly-active-users-tmau) - Are used to highlight stage expansion by summing the SMAUs across all stages. 
* [Monthly Active Users (MAU)](#monthly-active-users-mau) - Are the union of unique users in all SMAUs.
