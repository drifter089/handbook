## Structure

In order to provide a useful single metric for [product groups](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#product-groups) which maps well to product-wide Key Performance indicators, some product performance indicators cascade upwards. Here is how:

* [Action Monthly Active Users (AMAU)](#action-monthly-active-users-amau) - Are the building blocks, these are unique users performing a certain action. _For example_ - unique users interacting with a [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/operations/feature_flags.html)
* [Group Monthly Active Users (GMAU)](#group-monthly-active-users-gmau) - Are used for targeting the R&D efforts of [Product Groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups). These are the maximum from the set of the group's AMAUs. _For example_ - In the [Progressive Delivery group](/handbook/product/product-categories/#progressive-delivery-group), if [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/operations/feature_flags.html) AMAU was 9,000 users and [review apps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/) AMAU was 11,000 then the Progressive Delivery GMAU would be 11,000.
* [Stage Monthly Active users (SMAU)](#stage-monthly-active-users-smau) - Are used, in part, for targeting [R&D investments](/handbook/product/investment/#investment-by-stage) across multiple stages. These are the maximum from the set of the relevant GMAU's plus any stage level AMAU's that might not fall cleanly into a GMAU. _For example_ - In the [Release stage](/handbook/product/product-categories/#release-stage), if Release:Progressive Delivery GMAU is 11,000 and Release:Release Management GMAU is 8,000 and the Release-wide AMAU of unique users performing a deployment is 20,000 then the Release SMAU is 20,000.
* [Total Monthly Active Users (TMAU)](#total-monthly-active-users-tmau) - Is used to highlight stage expansion by summing the SMAUs across all stages. Unlike other MAU metrics, each user will be counted multiple times.
* [Monthly Active Users (MAU)](#monthly-active-users-mau) - Are unique users across the entire product.

_Note_ - For GMAU and SMAU there is a desire for these metrics to be the unique users across the aggregate of associated AMAU's but current limitations in how we receive usage ping data (already aggregated per event) means that is not currently possible. There is work to [create de-duplicated GMAU and SMAU metrics in Usage Ping underway](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/telemetry/-/issues/421).

Each xMAU metric should have three versions:
* Current = reported .com xMAU + reported self-managed xMAU 
* Estimated = reported .com xMAU + estimated self-managed xMAU.  The purpose of the estimated metric is to account for the fact that only 35% of self-managed instances report back xMAU data.  The estimation is methodology is described [here:](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/672950/[WIP]-Estimated-SMAU-MAU---Self-Hosted-(inaccurate))
* Projected = (reported .com xMAU + estimated self-managed xMAU) * 1 + current MoM growth rate * 36 months.  The purpose of the projected metric is to gain a sense for what usage could look like in 3 years at current growth rates.
