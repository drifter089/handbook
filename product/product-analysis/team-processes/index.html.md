## Gearing Ratios

At GitLab, we use gearing ratios as [Business Drivers](/handbook/finance/financial-planning-and-analysis/#business-drivers-also-known-as-gearing-ratios) to forecast long term financial goals by function. The Product Analysis group currently focuses on one gearing ratio: Product Managers per Product Analyst. In the future, we may consider other ratios (ex: Active Experiments per Product Analyst), but for the moment we are focussing on the PM:Product Analyst ratio.

### Targets

The long-term target for the Product Managers per Product Analyst ratio is 3:1. The ability of PMs to self-serve on day-to-day questions and activities is a critical component to finding success at this ratio, and finding the best tool is a focus of the R&D Fusion Team in FY22 Q3-Q4. In addition, we want to ensure that analysts are not spending more time context switching (changing from one unrelated task to another) and learning the nuances of different data sets than they are actually conducting analysis. We want our product analysts to spend their time answering complex questions, developing or improving metrics, and making business-critical recommendations.

In order to validate our target ratio, we looked at the practices of other large product organizations, including Linkedin, Intuit, HubSpot, Squarespace, iHeartRadio, and Peloton Digital. We found that most maintained a ratio of 1.5-3 PMs per product analyst, in addition to a self-service tool. As such, we feel comfortable setting a target of 3 PM:1 Product Analyst ratio.

### Closing the Gap

As a relatively new group at GitLab (established FY21 Q4), we are still growing the team and we have a lot of ground to cover to close the gap between the current state and our target ratio. As we onboard new team members, we will increase our coverage of the product organization, but in the interim, we encourage PMs to leverage [office hours](/handbook/product/product-analysis/#office-hours).
