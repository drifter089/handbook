## Product Analysis Handbook

The Product Analysis group consists of a team of product analysts. This group reports to the 
Director of Product, Growth and serves as a specialized analytics team to support product data 
analysis requests. The primary customer this group serves is Product Managers from various 
sections/groups.

Read more about what we do at GitLab on our [Direction](/direction/product-analysis/) page.

### Product Analysis group members

* [Carolyn Braza](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#cbraza): Manager, Product Data Analysis
* [Dave Peterson](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#dpeterson1): Senior Product Analyst
* [Nicole Galang](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#nicolegalang): Product Analyst
* Product Analyst: TBH

The product analysts also work closely with members from the central Data team, including:
* [Mathieu Peychet](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#mpeychet_): Senior Data Analyst

The Product Analysis group hopes to partner more closely with data engineers on the Data 
team, as well.

## Intake & Planning Process

The Product Analysis group works on a 2-week milestone cadence, which dictates how and when we 
plan and prioritize work.

You can see our current milestone [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/boards/2329061?scope=all&label_name[]=product%20analysis&milestone_title=%23started)

### Issue Intake

For all product analysis requests, please create an issue on [data team project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues), 
and add a `product analysis` label, as well as your section and group labels. More details below.

All data issues with `product analysis` labels will appear on a [product analysis board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=product%20analytics).

1. In the issue, please explain the urgency/criticality of the requests and provide as much context as possible.

#### Submission Deadline

In order to be considered for the upcoming milestone, please open all issues by EOD Wednesday before 
the next milestone begins. We understand that urgent matters come up, but please try to adhere to 
the submission deadline for any planned work. 
* You can find our milestone cadence/schedule here (Need something here on how to follow our schedule)

#### Issue Templates

* For ad hoc requests, please use the "Product Analysis Request" (link to come)
* For experimentation analysis requests, please use the [experiment template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/experiment_template.md)

#### Scope Creep

[Scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) is a problem everyone faces. Please keep 
in mind that [team capacity](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-analysis/#capacity) 
is a zero-sum game, so scope creep in one issue can mean that we are unable to complete other 
work planned for that milestone.

Additional scope that adds a material amount of work* to an issue will need to be captured as 
net-new work in a new issue. That new issue will then go through the prioritization and planning 
process again. The best way to avoid scope creep is to have thorough, complete requirements in 
the issue when you initially open it.

_*"material amount of work" is to be determined by the analyst working on the issue, not the 
stakeholder_

#### Urgent Issues

If an urgent matter comes up, please open an issue and tag your analyst contact (and/or @cbraza). 
Please include why the issue is urgent, when it is needed by, and who is the intended audience.

If you have not heard from the tagged analyst within 1 business day (or earlier if the issue 
requires a faster turn-around), please send a message in [#s_growth_data](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/s_growth_data/) 
and feel free to reach out to @cbraza.

#### Issue Weight

Each issues is assigned a weight based on complexity. (Please note that complexity is different 
from estimated time commitment).

#### Prioritization Labels

### Issue Prioritization

The Manager, Product Data Analysis will help prioritize the work based on importance/capacity and 
work closely with the Director of Product Growth, Chief Product Officer and VP, Product Management on trade-offs if needed.

#### 

### Issue Prioritization

The prioritization process is completed by the Product Analysis team.
1. The product analysis group works on a 2-week milestone cadence
  * You can see our current milestone [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/boards/2329061?scope=all&label_name[]=product%20analysis&milestone_title=%23started).
1. Prioritization to be set during the planning meeting the week before the start of the new milestone
1. Prioritization labels will be added to reflect the issue's impact and urgency
1. Issue will be assigned an estimated projected time commitment
1. New issues will be considered alongside existing issues to set prioritization for the upcoming 
milestone, adjusting task load based on past milestone performance.

### Capacity

As the Product Analysis team is still fairly new and small, we expect most PMs to self-serve 
on analysis and only create data issues for critical asks. As the group grows, so will our ability 
to support additional asks and analyses.
