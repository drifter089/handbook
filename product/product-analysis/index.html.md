## Welcome to the Product Analysis Group Handbook Page

The Product Analysis group consists of a team of product analysts. This group reports to the 
Director of Product, Growth and serves as a specialized analytics team to support product data 
analysis requests. The primary customer this group serves is Product Managers from various 
sections/groups, with a primary on the Growth stage.

1. All data issues with `product analysis` labels will appear on a [product analysis board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=product%20analytics).
1. In the issue, please explain the urgency/criticality of the requests and provide as much context as possible.

1. Prioritization to be set during the planning meeting the week before the start of the new milestone

## Capacity

As the Product Analysis team is still fairly new and small, we expect most PMs to self-serve 
analysis and only create data issues on critical asks. As the group grows, so will our ability 
to support additional asks and analyses.
