# Overview 

Co-selling with Alliance partners can help GitLab expand it's sales reach and impact to mutual customer bases. There are various ways co-sell partners help GitLab's sales cycle and can be classified in a few categories: 

* **Sourced Opportunities** : Alliance partner has an opportunity brought to GitLab for co-selling
  * **Source New** : Type of source opportunity in a new account (New Logo) for GitLab
  * **Source Growth** : Type of source opportunity in an existing account/customer for GitLab
* **Assist** : A type of opportunity where an Alliance partner is helping accelerate or expand an existing opportunity that was already created/generated by GitLab Sales or channel registered deal. 
* **Fulfillment** : Alliance partner has only transacted the deal (via Marketplace for example) with minimal to no direct co-sales assist. 

# Sales force Tagging 

Read more [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#alliances-and-oems) on how alliance deals are tagged and defined in the Channel Team's handbook page. Below is a more detailed overview of different types of deals, how they are tagged, and categorized as partner influenced sales for GitLab.


## Open Pipeline 

**[Example SFDC Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004afLJ)**

1. ***Registered opportunity to Alliance partner*** : These are deals registered with Alliance partners (via public cloud's partner portal for example) that are actively in the co-sell pipeline. These deals do not have an outcome yet since they are not closed opportunities. 

DR Partner | DR Partner Engagement | Influence Partner | DR - partner Deal Type
--- : --- : --- : --- 
None | None | Alliance Partner | None

## Assist Opportunities 

It should be noted that for each of the Alliance assist tagged opportunities, it is expected to have qualification notes in the Command plan outlining the Alliance partner and their value add to the deal (detailed joint call notes with next steps will suffice). 

**[Example SFDC Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004afL9)**

1. **Alliance assisted, sold through cloud marketplace**: These are deals transacted through cloud marketplaces where GitLab sellers and Alliance sellers got on joint calls and/or collaborated to help land, expand, or up sell an **existing** GitLab opportunity. These deals have closed/won/lost status. 

DR Partner | DR Partner Engagement | Influence Partner | DR - partner Deal Type
--- : --- : --- : --- 
Alliance Partner | Assisted | Alliance Partner | None

2. **Alliance assisted, sold directly via GitLab**: These are deals sold directly through GitLab sales but where GitLab sellers and Alliance sellers got on joint calls and/or collaborated to help land, expand, or up sell an **existing** GitLab opportunity. These deals have closed/won/lost status.

DR Partner | DR Partner Engagement | Influence Partner | DR - partner Deal Type

3. **Alliance assisted, sold via reseller**: These are deals sold via a mutual channel reseller, but also where GitLab sellers and Alliance sellers got on joint calls and/or collaborated to help land, expand, or up sell an **existing** GitLab opportunity or a **new** GitLab opportunity previously registered by a channel partner. These deals have closed/won/lost status. ` DR Partner Engagement` field will be determined by the type of engagement with the channel partner. The only attribution for Alliance partner impact where a channel partner is involved and transacting will be determined by the `Influence Partner` field.
