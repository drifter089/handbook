## Open to Collaboration

GitLab is an open product with a Core, open-source edition and an enterprise, open-core edition, with additional features that are closed-source.

We're open to integrations with companies and tools that are interested in harnessing GitLab's platform capabilities, user flows and data with their products.

For a list of the [GitLab Technology Partners](/partners/technology-partners/).

### Interested in a GitLab Technology Partnership?

GitLab is open to collaboration and committed to building technology partnerships in the DevOps ecosystem. If you are interested in becoming a GitLab Technology Partner, learn more on our [Integrate with us](https://about.gitlab.com/partners/integrate) page.

If you want to talk to us about a partnership please create a [New Partner Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/alliances/alliances/issues/new?issuable_template=new_partner) and share details about the technical integration, end user benefits and business relationship that you would ideally want. When creating an issue, please select new_partner issue template in the drop down.

## Sales Alignment with Platform Partners

We are able to connect with sales and technical teams at platform partners to accelerate deals and add value for customers.The best way to engage with platform partners is with active opportunities that include expansion for an existing customer and POV or technical evaluation for a prospect.

1. Reference Google Docs to review the sales enablement material on co-selling with the partner.
1. Identify active opportunities (at or about to enter Stage 3) or expansion with current customers.
1. Register the opportunities using the partner registration forms included below. This will allow us to gather the required information to register them in the partner's portal. Once the submission is approved by the partner, we will get an introduction to the account manager covering that account. This can take up to 3-5 business days.
1. For any questions on the above steps, navigating enablement material or if an opportunity is fit to engage a partner please reach out to Kasim Ahmad.

## Criteria for Successful Partnerships

1. Exposure - Partnerships which generate more exposure to new segments of audiences, integrations are a good example.
1. Product usage familiarity - more people using GitLab but not necessarily installing their own instance (GitLab.com), open source projects as an example.
1. Adoption - partnerships attracting more people to adopt GitLab for their own instance. Upstream and downstream partners help here.
1. Revenue - Revenue generating partnerships. Users come first but focus on revenue has ensured we have the revenue for sustainable growth.
1. Strategic - partners we find will add strategic value to our long term positioning and often around competitive situations.
1. Alignment - collaboration is stronger and our customers have a great experience when the Product, Marketing, and Sales teams are aligned.

## GitLab Delivery Models

There are many ways that GitLab can be both installed (/install/) and once installed many deployment environments that GitLab can target. Below is a structure to think about those options and some of the trade-offs that are made depending on the model.

- Self-managed - customer downloads, installs and maintains themselves
- Marketplace - self-managed but purchased through marketplaces
- GLaaSTS - fully managed (by the cloud provider) private instance of GitLab. Similar to the managed database options clouds offer.
- GitLab.com - fully managed multi tenent offer by GitLab Inc.

| Delivery Model | Self-Managed | Marketplace | GLaaSTS | GitLab.com |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
| **State** | Active | Soon | Future | Active |
| **Tenents** | Single | Single | Single | Multi |
| **Installation Package** | Omnibus/Helm | Omnibus/Helm | Helm | Moving to Helm |
| **Managed** | Self | Self | Cloud | GitLab |
| **Billing Ownership** | GitLab/Partner | GCP, AWS, DO, etc | Cloud | GitLab |
| **Infrastructure Incl.** | no | yes | yes | yes |
| **Partners** | SI's/VAR's | Clouds | Clouds | GitLab/Partner |
| **Sales Focus** | Hybrid/Multi-Cloud | Self-service | Self-service | Self-service |
| **Pricing** | user/yr | user/month or hour | user/yr | user/yr |
