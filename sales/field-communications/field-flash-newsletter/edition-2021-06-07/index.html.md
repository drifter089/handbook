### What's New in GitLab 🚀
The GitLab 13.12 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:
- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** On-Demand DAST scanning is now generally available for all GitLab Ultimate customers to help them ensure their production environment is always secure. In addition, GitLab Ultimate customers are invited to a public beta for a new browser-based crawler for DAST, which is expected to provide significantly better security testing coverage for modern applications compared to GitLab’s current proxy-based crawler. Lastly, the Project Vulnerability Report now gives customers the ability to filter by scanner and vendor, allowing them to more easily benefit from a unified scanner view in GitLab.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** GitLab has made pipelines easier to use for both new and experienced users with features like a collapsible panel of guided instructions that will help new CI/CD users create their first pipeline, the ability to break .gitlab-ci.yml files into multiple smaller files to improve reusability and readability, the ability to define variables within rules and a new view in the pipeline graph that shows dependencies between jobs. 
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** 13.12 embraces insights that improve customers’ DevOps maturity, including the introduction of a group-level deployment frequency chart, which will help customers understand the efficiency of their deployments over time, find bottlenecks, and focus on improvement areas that span across projects and teams. It also includes improvements to value stream analytics to help identify the root cause of inefficiencies in workflows.

![Alyssa-Belardi-TMS-Thumb](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/images/Alyssa-Belardi-TMS-Thumb.jpeg)

**Where did you grow up, and where are you based now?**

I grew up in a split household between San Francisco and Tiburon, California. I love the SF Bay Area and have been fortunate enough to stay here for my entire life (except for a short stint living in the Australian bush… slack me to hear that crazy story) and now reside in Orinda, CA. 

**What is your favorite thing about your job?**

Collaborating with various teams to achieve desired results. The most important part of my job is triangulating resources to tell an impactful story, prove the product, provide for and inspire our customers. Without the support of the broader GitLab team, I would most certainly not be able to do my job effectively. 

**Which of GitLab's Values resonates most with you?**

Results because I firmly believe one can’t achieve Results without Collaboration, Iteration, Diversity/Inclusion, Efficiency and Transparency. This GitLab value holds me accountable every day. 

**Do you have a helpful tip for working at GitLab to share?**

Don’t be shy in Slack channels. Using the channels yields incredible responses from multiple sources – I’ve learned so much from some of the conversations started with what I thought was a simple question. 

**What is a hobby or skill you have that the team might not know about?**

I collect vintage and unique glass items. Vases are my favorite - especially from Sklo Union, Rosenthal Studio and Louise Roe Copenhagen. I adore arranging flowers in special vases around the house, it’s my simple pleasure to make living itself an art. 

**Icebreaker: What was your favorite item of clothing as a kid?**

When I was 8, I loved my red high top Chuck Taylor converse… they were the best and I wore them until there were holes through the soles. I still love and wear high top chucks today!
