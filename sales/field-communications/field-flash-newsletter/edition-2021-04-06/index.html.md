1. **President‚Äôs Club Criteria -** Eligibility criteria for President‚Äôs Club 2022 has been announced. Check out the [Club handbook page](/handbook/sales/club/#selection-criteria) for more details. We hope to see you at the Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman Islands Resort in May 2022!

[See the issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/2077) for more details, and see the full list of Q1 QBR asks in the [Ask Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/1977). 
1. **Starter End of Availability Tracking -** To ensure we‚Äôre capturing Sales‚Äô engagement with our EoA customers, all EoA customers can now be tracked in SFDC leveraging the ‚ÄúFY22 On Starter/Bronze‚Äù field. Please review the process changes and corresponding reports in the [Go To Market handbook page](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#outreach--tracking-end-of-availability-customers).
1. **Starter End of Availability SLA -** Due to the extreme volume of EoA Ramp Deal requests, Deal Desk has published an SLA specifically for these requests. Please review the [handbook entry](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#sla-for-eoa-ramp-deal-requests) for more information.
1. **Improvements to #wins and #wins-key-deals Channels -** We are leveraging a new tool (Troops) to improve the readability of the alerts in these channels. You will now see alerts that provide a more holistic view of the won deal, highlighting key deal information without the need to click.

### Did You Know? üî¢
Finance and Sales Operations have collaborated to introduce a **new bookings policy that will determine the correct period to close a sales-assisted deal**. This policy is effective 2021-02-01, and can be [reviewed in full here](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#fy22-bookings-policy). 

*Policy Summary*

1. New Business, Add-On, and Renewal Opportunities with non-zero Net ARR can be closed no more than 15 days prior to the Quote Start Date.
1. Flat Renewals can be closed on or after the Quote Start Date.
1. Late Renewals will be Closed Lost if the renewal is not achieved within 45 days after the Quote Start Date (i.e. Renewal Date).

*Important Notes*

### What's New in GitLab üöÄ
The GitLab 13.9 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:
- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Teams no longer have to worry about balancing the security and availability of production environments with the new Security Alert Dashboard, which allows teams to discern between suspicious network activity that needs to be blocked immediately or that only needs further attention, minimizing disruption to users.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** The latest release further supports distributed teams through reduced downtime and increased visibility. This includes GitLab‚Äôs new Maintenance Mode, which enables read-only availability of customers‚Äô instances during admin tasks. This also includes the addition of  Release Analytics at the group level, which continues to grow our support of [DORA metrics](/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/devops-metrics/).
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** 13.9 makes the path to ‚Äúbetter products, faster‚Äù much more attainable with automation that helps identify redundancies in configuration and automation that helps mitigate complexity by making it easier to view pipeline configurations broken into many files and manage deployment processes leveraging parent-child or multi-project pipelines with resource groups.
