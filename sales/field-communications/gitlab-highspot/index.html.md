### FAQs

**How do I get access to Highspot?**

Highspot is currently only available to tool administrators and a small group of team members participating in the pilot program. All members of GitLab's GTM organization will have access to the tool once it is generally available in early CY22.

**Can all team members upload content into Highspot?** 

All team members can upload content into their own personal spot, but this content is only viewable by that person. Only team members who are permissioned as owners or co-owners of public spots can upload into these spots, which are viewable by all team members. 

**How do I request to become a content owner?** 

Please request access from the manager of Field Communications & Content.
