## Highspot at GitLab

Highspot is a sales enablement tool we use to gather, categorize, and share content within GitLab and externally to our customers.

### Why Highspot? 


### Key definitions

1. Spots - Spots are similar to a landing page. We use spots to provide quick access to specific content for a certain group or purpose.
1. Lists - Lists work as filters, and make it easier to find the content you need.
1. Content owners - Content owners are responsible for the management of content in Highspot, and can make high-level changes to the search structure as needed.

### Availability

Highspot is currently available to select GitLab team members as part of a pilot program that launched on 2021-11-15, and runs through the remainder of CY21. The tool will become generally available for all members of GitLab's go-to-market (GTM) organization in early CY22. 

Access to the tool is provisioned via SSO in Okta. To access Highspot, please navigate through the Highspot tile in your Okta dashboard.

Teams included in the GTM organization include: 
1. Sales 
1. Customer Success
1. Channel
1. Alliances

### FAQs

**How do I get access to Highspot?**

Highspot is currently only available to tool administrators and a small group of team members participating in the pilot program. All members of GitLab's GTM organization will have access to the tool once it is generally available in early CY22.

**Can all team members upload content into Highspot?** 

All team members can upload content into their own personal spot, but this content is only viewable by that person. Only team members who are permissioned as owners or co-owners of public spots can upload into these spots, which are viewable by all team members. 

**How do I request to become a content owner?** 

Please request access from the manager of Field Communications & Content.
