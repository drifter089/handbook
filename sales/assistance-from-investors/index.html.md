### FAQ's

- **Process Questions:**
    - Q: Are introductions available to all segments (Large, PubSec, MM, SMB)?
    - A: This is available to all segments, but primarily with Large -- want to focus on largest economic opportunities that make the biggest impact for GL, with focus on F500/Global2000 and large marquee tech brands in our investor's ecosystems

    - Q: Where do I add my top account and what information do I need to provide?
    - A:  Utilize the Investor Introductions Tracker sheet noted in the Resources section above where you will see the requested information do properly prepare the Investor team.

- **Review and Feedback**
    - Q: How often is the shared tracker reviewed by the Investor team - do we need to also notify them separately when a new account is added (and also ones that might be removed)?
    - A: The tracker will be reviewed intermittently but at a minimum once a quarter during the GitLab <> Investor regular cadence.  If accounts are added or removed from the tracker, the GitLab Sales team member should let Sales Operations and the EBA team know of the change so they can communicate that with the ICONIQ team. 

    - Q: How often does the Investor share feedback on progress and how is that feedback shared?
    - A: Feedback will happen in two junctures:
        1. Quarterly - during the GitLab <> Investor regular meeting schedule
        2. Intermittently (between GitLab <> Investor quarterly cadence calls)  
        - This feedback will be provided as ICONIQ makes progress against each account on the list.   During this time, progress will be shared via:
            - Investor Introductions Tracker
            - Directly through email
            - Directly through Slack
    - Q: Who from Investor team and GitLab will be involved in the regular cadence calls? 
    - A: Investor: Dependent on Investor preference

Critical that this context is complete, accurate and that ICONIQ can depend on it.  The email should be drafted in google doc format.

    - A: Rep should leverage the above templates and add in relevant content for the top target ICONIQ believes it might be able to help with. 

Q: What do I do after I’ve drafted the email in gdoc? 
A: Share the gdoc with your manager and add the link to the introductions tracker.  Your manager will review and offer feedback as needed. 

    - Q: How do the reps know when the email goes out? 
    - A: Invesotr DRI typically sends text or email to advise that it went out to best relationship owner, who is expected to communicate directly with the contact
