## Overview
Manager effectiveness is important to GitLab’s continued ability to attract, develop, and retain key talent and deliver scalable, efficient growth. In response, the Corporate L&D, People, and Field Enablement teams are collaborating to launch this FY22 program to equip managers with a foundational set of skills & practices for effectively managing remote teams across GitLab’s field organization.

## Target Audience
All people managers in the GitLab field organization

## Approach
Managers will participate in a series of quarterly training & reinforcement exercises throughout FY22. While there will be formal training elements, a large focus will be on social learning (learning from others) and practical, real-world application to convert knowledge to action.
- **Q1FY22** (2021-03-22): Program Launch & Recruiting Top Talent (virtual)
- **Q2FY22** (2021-05-24, 2021-05-26, and 2021-06-02): Field Manager Challenge (virtual)
- **Q3FY22** (Dates TBD): Field Manager Summit (in-person at Contribute)

1. Winning Top Talent
