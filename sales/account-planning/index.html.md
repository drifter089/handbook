## Overview 

An Account Plan is a single document that contains important details about a new prospect or existing customer, including information about their decision-making process, the companies you’re competing with, and your overall strategy to win them over (and retain them). 

Think about account planning as if you were the CEO of your own territory. If you were a CEO, what information would you need to give banks, investors, or employees to demonstrate that you have a viable business plan that you can execute? An account plan is a business plan that helps you analyze and execute on your business.  

## Account Planning vs. Success Planning

A customer’s business and strategies will change, to stay up to date, share the account plan to the account team regularly to help keep a fresh understanding of the customer's needs. 

It's recommended for SALs to use QBRs and/or other recurring meetings such as SALSA/TAM Calls) to review steps achieved thus far and set next steps or new objectives as needed. 

## Building the Account Plan
