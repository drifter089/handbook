## Welcome!

The Order Management page outlines the goals, tasks, and standard operating guidelines for each regional team. Here you will find more information about our KPIs, SLAs, and best practices for working with our team. 

For an indepth overview of Opportuntiy Approval Booking Requirements, please review our  Sales Order Processing page.

### Meet the Team 

The Order Management team is located around the world and will be available during standard business hours within most regions. We operate under a Regional Support Model, meaning, each region (EMEA/APAC/AMER) will recieve support from dedicated Order Management Specialists. During holidays, or when team members are on PTO, individuals located in a different region may step in to support and ensure appropriate coverage. This is reserved for EoM / EoQ or times when we are understaffed. 

You can expect support based on the following business hours in your region. However, complex/non-standard opportunities that are submitted after 4:30PM local time may be reserved for the following business day. 

|     Region    | Standard Support Hours |
|:-------------:|------------------------|
| APAC          | 8:00AM to 5:00PM       |
| EMEA          | 8:00AM to 5:00PM       |
| AMER / LATAM  | 7:00AM to 5:00PM PT    |

Our regional teams do not operate on a 24/7 support model. If your opportunity or case is submitted after 4:30PM local time, or outside of standard support hours, it will be reviewed the following business day. The only exceptions for this are EoM / EoQ / EoY. Support hours and availability will be shared in advance of high volume periods through #field-fyi. 

### Key Performance Indicators

#### Standard Approval SLA 

Opportunities will be reviewed for all booking requirements within 12 business hours of being Submitted for Approval (Stage 7 - Closing). Your opportunity will be Approved or Rejected by Order Management within 12 hours. Please note, ultimate closure of a deal depends on our Billing team. Please review their standard SLA (LINK HANDBOOK PAGE)

If there are missing booking requirements, or furhter confirmation required from the Sales team, the Order Management specialist will tag you directly in Chatter to resolve any outstanding issues.

Please review our Sales Order Processing page for Opportunity Booking Requirements. 

#### Regional Support Satisfaction 

All regions will recieve a Quarterly Customer Satisfaction survey at the beginning of each new quarter. Our team aims for a 92% satisfaction rating for their supported region. This survey is a value tool to provide feedback on areas of improvement related to the Opportuntiy Approal Process. 

#### Opportunity Approval Accuracy and Efficiency 

Our team aims for an Approval Accuracy of 95% or greater. Meaning, of all opportunites that we submit to Billing for final review / approval, 5% or less will be rejected for missing booking requirements. 

Order Management Specialists will be responsible for taking action on feedback recieved in Quarterly CSAT survey, as well as improving process related to common opportuntiy rejections, whether it be through documentation, training, or system improvements. The goal is to reduce time to approval, improve efficiency and maintain a high level of accuracy for all approvals. 

### Approval Escalation Path 

Occasionally, an opportunity will require escalation to fast track the approval process. You may escalate the need for approval by: 

1. Submitting the opportunity for Approval and 
2. Chattering Sales-Support requesting prompt review of the opportunity. 
3. You must provide a legitimate reason for escalation. Do not escalate an opportunity for approval if it is not urgent. 

Please do not escalate opportunities during EoM/EoQ/EoY. All efforts will be made to book opportunties that are submitted during these periods. Tagging the team for escalation only creates more noise to filter through. 


### How to Contact Us 

Our team actively monitors @Sales-Support in chatter. Your case will be responded to within 6 hours of opening. This is subject to our standard support hours outlined above.
