## Why is meeting live on chorus?

- Zoom and Chorus have gone through a lot of legal and development cycles to be transparent in what data is being used for all participants, so the verbiage cannot be customized at this time.

## Recording with Breakout Rooms

- Chorus will not capture the breakout rooms, only the main Zoom meeting will be captured.
- Please note: By default Chorus has rules around silence on a call. If participants are put into breakout rooms for longer than 5 minutes in the middle of the call, Chorus will drop out of the call due to silence thinking the meeting is over.
