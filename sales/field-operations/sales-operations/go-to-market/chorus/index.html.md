## Security

- Any time a Chorus link is shared, a password should be required or the link should be set to expire. Each user has to do this; it can not be turned on globally from the admin panel.
As a best practice, we should NEVER include links to Chorus recordings in a public issue. If you need to include a Chorus recording or any type of customer information in an issue, please first make the issue private.
For additional details, please see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/sirt/operations/-/issues/1560#note_702890753).

## Why is meeting live on chorus?
- Zoom and Chorus have gone through a lot of legal and development cycles to be transparent in what data is being used for all participants, so ihe verbiage cannot be customized at this time. 
- They (Chorus and Zoom) do see some areas internally where this is under further review, so it is possible Zoom/Chorus could work to update the message at some point. 

## Recording with Breakout Rooms
- Chorus will not capture the breakout rooms, only the main zoom meeting will be captured.
- Please note: By default Chorus has some rules around silence on a call. So if participants are put into breakout rooms for longer than 5 minutes in the middle of the call, Chorus will drop out of the call due to silence thinking the meeting is over
