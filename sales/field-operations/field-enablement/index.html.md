## Overview

The Field Enablement team's mission is to help customers successfully grow and evolve in their journey with GitLab to achieve positive business outcomes with effective enablement solutions aligned to [Gitlab’s values](/handbook/values/). We do this by:
*  Collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders (including but not limited to Sales, Customer Success, Marketing, Sales Ops, Product/Engineering, and the People team) to lead the facilitation of prioritized behavior change in the GitLab Field Team to achieve desired business outcomes.
*  Defining, coordinating, and/or leading the development and delivery of effective enablement solutions for GitLab Sales, Customer Success, and Partners throughout all phases of the customer journey as well as different stages of each team member's tenure and/or experience at or with GitLab.
*  Championing the needs and interests of the Field Team (all routes to market) – ensuring that they are regularly informed about relevant business and organizational updates and have access to enablement materials necessary for day-to-day work to meet and exceed business objectives.

<summary markdown="span">Key Discussion Points</summary>

- Our [Mission](/company/strategy/#mission) is that Everyone Can Contribute, and our most important value is [Results](/handbook/values/#results). Like we've extended that to the Handbook, we want to extend it to our Learning Materials.
- We want to leverage the best of an e-learning platform, with the benefits of reminders, interactivity, and more but make sure the materials we produce are also available to those who aren't using an e-learning platform, while fulfilling [our mission](/company/strategy/#mission).
- There are benefits to keeping our e-learning material [handbook-first](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first):
   * Folks who have already completed a formal training through an e-learning platform may want to return to the materials
   * Those who never go through the formal platform may also benefit from the materials
   * The handbook continues to be the SSOT, with the e-learning platform leveraging handbook materials through screenshots, embeds, and more
