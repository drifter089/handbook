## Goals of the Field Ops Release Schedule 

The goal of the Field Ops release schedule is to consolidate important, need-to-know Field Ops updates and deliver them on a predictable schedule to the GitLab Field team. 

Because of the pace at GitLab, the Field team is often overwhelmed by the amount of information sent to them. A release schedule helps reduce confusion and increase engagement by consolidating the Field Ops-related updates and, thus, "lightening the load" on the Field team. It also allows the Field team to rely on receiving Field Ops updates at the same place and time. Furthermore, prioritization around release schedule themes and timelines allows Field Ops team to ship more purposefully in order to support more meaningful change and allow ample time for behavior changes.

### Release Schedule Scope

The updates considered in this process should be *strictly* system/process-based. Other announcement should go through the normal [Field Announcement Request process](/handbook/sales/field-communications/#requesting-field-announcements).

Sales Ops, CS Ops, Channel Ops & Deal Desk (Systems as a supplementary, but they are usually incorporated as a part of Ops updates)
