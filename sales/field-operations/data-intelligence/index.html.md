## <i class="far fa-newspaper" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Charter

Data Intelligence (DI) is a part of Field Operations reporting to Revenue Operations. Our goal is to ensure the field has reliable and quality Salesforce.com sales data to empower them to make repeatable and structured decisions to increase sales and make GitLab more successful. We aim to manage data well and be viewed as a trusted business partner for Sales Operations, Marketing Operations, and Management. 

Data intelligence aims at ensuring that impacted parties understand the data and the best uses of the data. This is achieved through enablement to the field on data enrichment, data governance, data cleaning, and overall fostering a data culture to make data-driven decisions and drive results.

## <i class="far fa-paper-plane" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> How to Communicate with Us

**Slack channels**

We do not use or create tool-specific Slack channels (e.g. `#zoominfo`).

- [#dataintelligencehelp](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/dataintelligencehelp) - We use this channel for general data intelligence support. We attempt to [avoid direct messages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages) where possible as it discourages collaboration. 

**Salesforce**

The Data Intelligence team uses the '@sales-support' Chatter in Salesforce to help you make changes or manage account changes in Salesforce. Please note, the more information you can provide in your support request, the faster the request can be resolved. Use the '@sales-support' Chatter for support with:
* Account Merges: Merging duplicate accounts in different ownership
* Account Name Changes: Investigating and Changing the Account Name, note: this is not to change the account to the correct owner, this is to change the account name to reflect the legal name. Example: Company name = "ABC" but legally it is "ABC, Inc." 
* Account Hierarchy Clean-up
* Account Data/Segmentation Reviews - Employees
* Account Data/Segmentation Reviews - Address
* LAM field
* JiHu Accounts 

The Data Intelligence Team does not support the following:
* Opportunity Ownership Misalignment
* Account Ownership Misalignment
* Order Type Review/Updates
* ISR Field Population
* PubSec/Government Account Review
* Please see the Sales Operations team to assist with these [requests] (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/)

### Focus Fridays

[Focus Fridays](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#focus-fridays). Please try not to schedule meetings for team members on Fridays, so they can devote time for deep work in milestone-related issues.
