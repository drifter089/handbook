## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Question: Activated Users is great, but when will I be able to see SMAU and other activity metrics?**<br />
Answer: The Product and Data teams are working to get these metrics at the subscription level, and when they do we will add to this dash! [Follow the progress here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17dw3qpX5PbvF_WwQXNEQuCPqGUcng1zy85R-2fIL1k8/edit#heading=h.t3mpohrk83kp).


**Question: I viewed one of my Accounts, and some of the Subscription Data says "Not Available", what went wrong?**<br />
Answer: Activated User data is not yet available for some subscriptions based on Namespace collisons or requires enhancemen to Seatlink.
