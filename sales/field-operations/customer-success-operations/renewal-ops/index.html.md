- Accurately forecast churn and contraction with a high degree of confidence
- Analyze drivers of Churn and Contraction and provide strategic recommendations to mitigate risk
- Ensure an exceptional level of data quality within tools and systems
- Identify, build and iterate process improvements to improve account management effectiveness

- **Improve Workflows**

## Get in Touch
Head over to [#renewal-ops](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNDQwMzIxMzIzNzQ2Mi1lOGJlNmU2NDg5YzM5YzZlZDc0ZmI2YTM2NzQyZmU2OTM1NWMzMjY0NTFhN2QzMTYxMDI3NGZhNmVlNTY2ZmVm) on Slack to get in touch with us. We use this channel for general Renewal Operations support, and key system status updates. We attempt to avoid direct messages where possible as it discourages collaboration.

## Who We Work With

Renewal Operations supports the Renewals and Sales Teams: Directors & Area Sales Managers, Renewals Managers, Account Executives, Strategic Account Leaders and collaborates with Customer Success Operations, and Sales Operations.

**Renewals Team** is Renewal Operationsâ€™ direct focus, our primary customer being the Sr. Director, Renewals; the insights, strategies, and actionable campaigns are built to assist the Renewal Managers and Account Executives with the renewal process.  Renewals Operations provides intelligent insights for the large amount of upcoming renewals managed by Account Teams to allow a more focused approach.

**Customer Success Operations** helps organize and collect pertinent product usage, and  customer health data that the Renewal Operations Team uses to identify insights and engagement strategies. For example, creating automated one-to-many campaigns in Gainsight to support product adoption.

**Sales Operations** supports Renewal Operations by maintaining our systems that process the renewals and opportunity management. As we progress, it can also improve risk management and forecasting. 

## Renewal Operations Projects

Renewal Operations uses issues and issue boards to track our projects and tasks. If your expertise can assist in any of our projects or if you simply want to share an idea you believe could assist the Renewals process, please open an issue and add the ~RenewalOps label anywhere within the GitLab repo.

See the [Renewal Operations issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/3126050?scope=all&label_name[]=RenewalOps) to track progress.
