## Deal Registration

<details>
<summary markdown="span">
When should I submit a Deal Registration? What opportunities am I able to register?
</summary>

GitLab has a Partner Sourced Deal Registration (DR) program for (i) Resale, (ii) MSP, and (iii) Referral opportunities. You should submit a Partner Sourced DR for an opportunity where you are sourcing net-new business for GitLab, which can apply to opportunities for new logo, co-term add-on/upsell, or add-on/upsell as part of a renewal. Note, there can only be one Partner Sourced DR approved for an opportunity, as only one partner can source a deal. You should not submit a Partner Sourced DR if you did not source the opportunity, and you will generally receive Co-Sell discounts for these deals. Partner Sourced and Co-Sell opportunities are discussed further in the Partner handbook.

GitLab also has a Service Attach DR program which applies to opportunities where partners are selling their own professional services into a customer environment at the time of a GitLab product sale.

What does it mean when the status of a Deal Registration is "Returned”?

The Channel Account Manager (CAM) assigned to the Deal Registration (DR) has reviewed and sent it back to the resale partner for additional information/context. Once the resale partner reviews and responds to the CAM's feedback, the CAM will be notified to review and action the updated DR.
