## Deal Registration

<details>
<summary>
When should my partner submit a Deal Registration? What opportunities are they able to register?
</summary>

GitLab has a [Partner Sourced Deal Registration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration) (DR) program for Resale, MSP, and Referral opportunities. The partner should submit a Partner Sourced DR for an opportunity where they are **bringing net-new business to GitLab**, which can apply to opportunities for new logo, co-term add-on/upsell, or add-on/upsell as part of a renewal. Note, we can only approve one Partner Sourced DR for an opportunity, as only one partner can source a deal. Partners should not submit a Partner Sourced DR if they did not source the opportunity, and will generally receive Co-Sell discounts for these deals. Please refer to GitLab’s [Internal Incentive Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiT_2EsnL20c4w0hyZ_CGaJQIzj8CSCsHERoR80cwws/edit#heading=h.9e3o7yaxw8mu) for more information on partner program discounts.

GitLab also has a [Service Attach DR](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#service-attach-opportunities) program which applies to opportunities where partners are selling their own professional services into a customer environment at the time of a GitLab product sale.
