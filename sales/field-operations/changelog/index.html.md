The Field Operations Changelog keeps a running log of Field Ops changes related to Sales Ops, CS Ops, Channel Ops & Deal Desk. The log is organized by fiscal year/quarter and sub-organized by the bi-weekly Field Ops release milestone/epic. It was started in Q3-FY22 and is organized by newest updates at the top. Any entries that were included in a Field Ops Release are **bolded**.

To learn more about Field Ops releases, see the [Field Ops Release Schedule handbook page](/handbook/sales/field-operations/release-schedule/).
