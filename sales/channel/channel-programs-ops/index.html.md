### Overview
This page documents the operational information and processes for managing the Channel Program Operations.  This page does not include transactional processes, which are available on the [Channel Operations Handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/).


# Partner Contracts

Partners register to join the GitLab Partner Program by registering at partners.gitlab.com.  You can find more details about the registration process on the [Channel Operations Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-applicant-approval--denial---granting-portal-access) page.  As part of that process, partners are able to review and approve the GitLab partner program agreement.  For partners that do not agree to all the terms of the agreement, the Legal Request process is available to negotiate contact terms.

The following are the available partner agreements and addenda:



*   Master Partner Agreement (MPA) - This includes the primary terms and conditions for all reseller, services and referral partners.
*   Reseller Addendum - The Reseller addendum covers resale and renewal terms and conditions and must be signed by all partners reselling GitLab products and services.  
*   Referral / Services Addendum - This addendum to the MSA defines the terms and conditions for referral and services payment to partners.  All partners offering services around GitLab or partners referring, but not resellering GitLab must sign this agreement
*   Managed Services Provider Agreement - This is a special agreement for any partner that will be offering GitLab managed services.
*   Training Partner Addendum - All partners that will be offering GitLab training services utilizing GitLab training materials and train the training programs must sign this addendum.

Copies of the contract templates can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nwh6jt1TYJiida9CJb6YdexIxZZEI5UO?usp=sharing).

Partner agreements are limited to a single region (Americas, EMEA, APAC, Public Sector), unless otherwise approved by Channel leadership.

# Partner Portal Administration

Members of the Channel team are granted access to the Partner Portal Admin Console.  This console enables team members to track partner engagement and view partner data.  Partner data is synched between the Partner Portal and Salesforce, so GitLab team members that have access to Salesforce can find all the partner data there.

The Admin console capabilities include:



1. Engagement metrics - Partner portal engagement metrics, such as logins, asset usage, new accounts and web analytics can be found under the Channel Intel tab.
2. Salesforce sync - Data is synchronized between the Partner Portal and Salesforce in near real time.  As data is updated in one system, it is automatically syned to the other.  The Salesforce team, along with Channel Ops and Programs maintain the synchronization.  The CRM sync is set up under Admin Settings, CRM.  
3. Workflows - Workflows are set up to take an action based on a new partner being added to the system or updates to a partner account or user record.  Workflows are found under the Setting tab.  Workflows have been set up to notify team members of a new partner sign ups, automatically provide partners with Portal login credentials, assign journeys, update data fields and other activities.  The Channel Programs team maintains the workflows.
4. Training courses and exams are available for partners in the Portal.  The courses are maintained by Field Enablement and Channel Programs.  Once the GitLab LXP is rolled out to partners, partners will access the LXP through the portal via single sign-on.
5. Journeys are set up to assign a partner a set of specific tasks and activities.  For example, new partner users are assigned an onboarding Journey.  Journeys are set up and maintained by the Channel Programs team.

## Internal NFR Request Processes

**General NFR Request Process**

Requestor (CAM/partner) fills out the [NFR License Request form](https://forms.gle/Jszh53YChAuAvL1U8).

This creates a new line in the associated spreadsheet.

Notification is sent from the spreadsheet to anyone who has notifications set up (see **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Set Up Google Form Spreadsheet Notifications</span> [insert link to heading]**).

Partner Help Desk (PHD) reviews request to verify:



*   If the partner account is Authorized in Impartner
*   If there are any existing NFR licenses - check license.gitlab.com with the partner account name to see if the Partner already has any existing NFR licenses.
    *   Select Partners are allowed up to 25 licenses, Open Partners up to 10 licenses
    *   If existing licenses, set the expiration date to the same expiration date as existing license (unless this is a renewal of course)
*   If the partner has at least one employee who has completed the Solution Architect Certification or Professional Services Engineer Certification training, lab and exam (with a passing score).
    *   Check in Impartner for certifications by going to the Training tab
    *   Next to the Certification: _Solution Architect Core,_ click the number in the “Completed” column to display all certification completions and sort by account to see if a certification has been completed.
    *   Next to the Certification: _GitLab Trusted Professional Services Engineer (PSE) Certification,_ click the number in the Completed column and sort by account to see if a certification has been completed.
    *   If the partner has no certifications yet, but meets the other two eligibility criteria above, currently we can still send the NFR license, but we should encourage the partner to complete the Solution Architect Core. See sample email to Partner contact and CAM, once the license has been sent, below:

        _Subject Line: NFR License Request_


        _Hi [Partner License Contact],_


        _We just sent you an email with your NFR license, please let us know if you did not receive it. _


        _To ensure you receive the most value from this license, we encourage you or someone in your organization to complete the available parts of the Solution Architect Core certification in the Partner Portal. _


        _Please let us know if you need anything else._


        _Kind regards,_


PHD works with partner if additional information is needed.

If verified, PHD follows the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Creating and Sending NFR Licenses [insert link to heading]</span> **process (i.e. goes to license.gitlab.com and creates new license according to the request submitted in the form). 

When submitted, an email with the license is auto-generated to the Contact Email provided and is auto-logged under the Contact Name in Salesforce. 



*   To confirm the license has been sent, find the Contact Name in Salesforce and then view the Activity History on the contact record. The activity Subject will be _Email: GitLab Ultimate Trial License Key for..._ with the email address and a reference number.

PHD informs requestor license has been sent.

**Creating and Sending NFR Licenses**



1. Once you’ve confirmed the partner is eligible to receive NFR licenses, login to license.gitlab.com
2. Click the green button in the upper right corner “New license”
3. Enter this info at minimum: 
*   Name
*   Company
*   Email
*   Users count
*   GitLab Plan = Ultimate (default)
*   Check Trial checkbox
*   Starts at = Today’s date
*   Expires at = 1 year (unless the partner already has existing NFR licenses, then set to the expiration date of the existing license so that all licenses expire the same day and can be reviewed and renewed, if needed, at the same time) 
*   Notes = [User count] [GitLab Plan] NFR Licenses for Partner: [Insert Name]
4. Click _Create License_ button

**Access Request to Generate NFR Licenses**

In order to send NFR licenses to partners, you first need to have access to dev.gitlab.org. This access then allows you access to license.gitlab.com, where we issue NFR licenses from.

## **Partner Communications**


## **Partner Flash Newsletter**


## Overview

Partner Flash is a monthly newsletter that recaps important Partner-related information from the month and highlights important upcoming information. The main goal of this communication is to **help Partners ramp quickly and grow their GitLab business.**


## Target Audience

The newsletter is sent to authorized users in our Partner community, the list is gathered and updated from the Partner Portal, new users are added or you can self serve by going to [this link.](https://gitlab.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5a5f55e4e0f03037d96416766&id=2321e18463)


## Opportunities/Requirements

The newsletter will…

**Uphold our ****[values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) of transparency**



*   The newsletter is for communication, the Handbook is for documentation. This means that the newsletter will disseminate updates but lean on the Handbook (and other relevant resources) as the main source of documentation, linking back to it wherever possible. Items will also be referenced in the GitLab Partner Portal.

**Prioritize repetition, brevity, user-friendliness and added value**



*   The newsletter will focus on short lists and bullet points and will link out to more robust resources.
*   Repetition is key to adoption. We will encourage our Channel teams to talk about Partner Flash and will remind Partners in our upcoming Partner Webcast series and on the GitLab Partner portal.
*   We want Partners to value the newsletter. A key to adoption will be successfully positioning it as THE resource to learn what's new and recap important information. Everything will be tied back to the payoff to the Partner or seller when possible.
*   We must reconcile the fact that this newsletter is yet another increase in communication. We will leverage it to cut down on other communications when possible.

**Be fun to look at and read**



*   A focus on multimedia is important in order to help the newsletter break the monotony of text Partners sift through each day.
*   We will use images, gifs, emojis, and video where possible. For example, instead of doing a written win-wire, we will interview the individual and embed that 30-60 second video in the newsletter.

**Help the Channel operationalize key messages**



*   We will organize information around our 3 main value drivers when possible.
*   We will frequently reiterate Sales and Channel messages through video clips and use-case examples.

**Be an opportunity for the Partner Community to "learn themselves"**



*   A peripheral goal of the newsletter is to advertise helpful resources to the Partners. We will provide helpful information in hopes that it will encourage them to seek out the source of that information and look for additional information once there.

**Highlight _all_ aspects that make a big win possible**



*   There are a lot of new Partners and sales reps who are ramping up on GitLab, we want to provide easy to access to information to help them ramp quickly.
*   We will include context around partners and alliances when they play a role in a deal.

**Keep the onus on individuals to stay informed**



*   GitLab is asynchronous, this communication is in place to help provide quick access to relevant topics, the newsletter is not a substitute for the Handbook or other resources salespeople should be leveraging on the day-to-day.

**Be general enough to allow us to remain segment-agnostic**



*   The newsletter will include general updates and resources that are applicable to most, if not all, Partners. I
*   **Be built out in the open**
*   The newsletter content will be compiled in an issue each month within the [Partner Communication project.](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/channel/-/epics/5) Any team member is welcome to contribute or make requests. See more information in the Process section below.

**Uphold our value of "everyone can contribute" – we will measure success and gather Partner feedback often. **



*   We will measure success using a combination of quantitative and qualitative success metrics. See Measurement section below.
*   Giving feedback or making requests will be easy, and all input will be considered and addressed.
*   The team is committed to upholding the value of the newsletter – information should be relevant, feedback should be actioned on, and leadership should help reiterate by pointing to it as a useful resource for their teams.


## Format

Based on the requirements above, this is the first iteration of the newsletter format:



1. Featured
    *   The announcement we think is most impactful to our Partners he field. We will try to communicate this in an image with 1-2 lines of text + 1-2 links to references.
2. Enablement Extras
    *   Updates on new or updated training + opportunities to reinforce SKO learning objectives. (i.e. Did you know…?/Did you remember that…?)
    *   Competitive information
    *   Messages from our Leadership teams
3. New and noteworthy resources
    *   Link to that month’s Partner Webcast series
    *   GitLab whitepapers, reports or studies that might help a Partner advance an opportunity through the sales cycle.
4. Partner Deal of the month (or Deal of the Month if appropriate to share)
    *   Video of sales/CS team member(s) overviewing the opportunity and/or customer and explaining how they won the deal + links to any customer-facing collateral they used (that can be publicly shared).
5. What's new in GitLab
    *   The top 3 takeaways from the latest GitLab release, mapped to one of the three value drivers and framed in the context of the customer value.


## Process

The newsletter is sent out **on the first Thursday of each month after our Partner Webcast series has concluded.** We can adjust delivery based on feedback from the field, holidays or timing of a Partner focused update (pricing).

We build the newsletter in an issue in the [Partner Communication project.](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/channel/-/epics/5)The process for the issue includes:



*   The issue for each month's newsletter is opened at the beginning of each quarter.
*   Relevant stakeholders/contributors are tagged in the issue each month to provide content or review suggested content in the outline.
*   Once the outline is complete, the content is imported into the newsletter template in MailChimp.
*   Partner Program Manager sends the newsletter test email to relevant leaders and stakeholders for review no more than two business days before planned send date.
*   Reviewers provide feedback no later than 3 pm MT on the business day before the planned send date to allow time for revisions and scheduling.
*   Partner Program Manager schedules the newsletter to send on the planned send date.
*   Once the newsletter goes live, Partner Programs Manager sends a reminder to the field in the #sales, #customer-success and #sdr_global Slack channels
*   On the Friday following the newsletter send, Partner Program Manager captures the newsletter performance data in the issue and then closes it.

## **Channels groups, projects, and labels**

**Groups** Use the GitLab.com group for epics that may include issues within and outside the Channels Team group.



*   https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1508300?label_name[]=Channel
*   Guidelines for Partner Folders:
    *   The partners Group is further divided into regional sub-groups
    *   Within each region sub-group Partners will get their own group
    *   Partner groups contain a collaboration project and internal project
    *   Partner employees should be explicitly invited to collaboration group
    *   Internal group should not be visible to non-GitLab employees and may contain licensing details or other sensitive information

*   Broad initiatives will have EPICs with several issues to support that project

**Labels**



*   **Team labels**
    *   Channel- issue initially created, used in templates, the starting point for any label that involves Channels
    *   Channel Ops - label for issues that directly impact the Channel Ops & team. DRI will be defined in the intro of the issue
