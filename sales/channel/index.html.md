## Channels OKR

[OKRs](/company/okrs/)

### Channels Value 

The Channel is a critical part of our strategy moving forward as it will help us:
1. Drive growth ARR through services capacity and capability to drive customer adoption and usage of the GitLab platform.
1. Drive and increase new customer ARR through their relationships, service engagements, and knowledge of accounts.

![GitLab Channel Value](/handbook/sales/channel/images/channel_handbook1.png)

The purpose of this page is to provide the  GitLab Sales team insights on the GitLab channel partner community and how to best work with our partners.

*   [Channel Partner Program page]( https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/) - This page provides an overview of the GitLab channel partner program, the expectations of partners, benefits for partner and how partners can work with GitLab. 


## **Channels Partner Types**


### **Resellers**

Primary monetization is through reselling GitLab licenses and services. Resellers can be a service partner too (often known as a Solution Provider).



1. VAR/VAD (Value Added Reseller or Distributor): Channel services including resale, implementation, contracting, support, financing etc.
2. DMR (Direct Market Reseller): Primary business is resale of the software, often does not implement. Value are the contracts that these partners have in place with customers.


### **Services partners**

Primary monetization is through the sale of services. This can be a one-time implementation, ongoing support or advisory, managed services, or outsourcing. Services partners will resell GitLab services, deliver services on behalf of GitLab or deliver GitLab certified services. Services partners can be a reseller partner too (often known as a Solution Provider).



1. Global Systems Integrators have a large global workforce and can deliver on almost any customer need. Examples: Accenture, Deloitte, TCS, Wipro
2. Regional Systems Integrators are large workforce but with single continental focus and a more limited offering of services. Examples: CI&T, Slalom
3. Boutique Systems Integrators are very focused DevOps partners that could be deep experts on GitLab and the nuances of getting it setup and running it. Examples - CloudReach, Flux7
4. Managed Service Providers provide ongoing support for solutions/applications. Examples: Rackspace


### **Alliances**

[Alliances](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/alliances/)

**How can GitLab sellers benefit from our channel partners?**

GitLab channel partners have established sales forces that help us multiply our sales coverage.  Through that coverage and deep customer relationships, partners can identify new customer opportunities and new sales opportunities with existing customers, resulting in ARR growth.  Through their service offerings and vendor partnerships, they can deliver more complete solutions than GitLab can alone, and drive customer adoption of GitLab.  As a result, the GitLab channel will:



1. Improve customer reach and experience
    1. Resellers/SI’s that know & can make intros to  your customers
    2. Ease of order processing
2. Channel leverage
    3. Resellers/SI’s that bring us into new opportunities & grow existing
    4. Decreased Customer Acquisition Cost 
    5. Improved Net & Gross Retention
3. Services Capacity to Adopt and Expand GitLab deployments
    6. SI’s that help our customers deliver more value 
    7. Stage Monthly Active Users Acceleration
4. Market Position
    8. Acquire partners from the Atlassian/Cloud Bees channel 
    9. Monetize the GitHub channel 
    10. Align to the AWS channel

**Partners can help you scale and working with them is comp neutral**

**[Channel Neutral Compensation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/commissions/#channel-neutral-compensation)**

FY21 commissions will be channel neutral for all deals through partners (including Distributors, if applicable), which means standard partner discounts are credited back to the salesperson and must follow [order processing procedures](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/order-processing/) to correctly flag partner attribution. Total IACV on the deal after all discounts will count towards quota credit, but the channel neutral amount does not qualify for quota credit and only pays out for compensation at BCR. See Channel Neutral section referenced in the [FY21 Commission Plan presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lPZAmdHPPJwhJ4felwsgDXopIt7Usn3UnK5siOpQMlY/edit#slide=id.g7da31a6494_6_0)

Partner Services also qualify for [FY21 Professional Services Spiff (v2)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/commissions/#fy21-professional-services-spiff-v2).  So as partners help customers adopt and expand their GitLab deployments, they can earn a Services Attach rebate and the GitLab sales team can earn the Professional Services Spiff.

**Maximizing value by working with Channel Partners**

Developing successful relationships with channel partners in your region requires some effort, but has a great payback.  Following are a few key tips that will help you develop relationships with GitLab channel partners and greatly increase your sales effectiveness.



*   **Honor Partner ←→ Customer Relationships**
    *   **Respect Deal Reg’s from Partners:  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">No</span>** direct sales of opportunities with approved Partner Deal  Reg without prior approval of VP, Global Channel Sales 
    *   **Recognize Incumbent Partners***: Do not bring another Partner into your customer convos
*   **For new Deal Reg’s in your pipeline**
    *   Be prepared to construct a simple joint pursuit plan in SFDC (CAMs are here to support same)
    *   Strive to team with the trained Partner people
*   **The program determines the partner discount**
    *   Our agreement with partners is that by initiating, assisting or fulfilling sales opportunities, or selling services, partners will earn set amount based on their partner track.
    *   These discounts are determined by the program and not GitLab Sales on individual opportunities.
*   **Respect incumbent partners**
    *   Support them in driving renewals and incremental sales
    *   Do not bring competing partners into the account
*   **Stay Focused on the Customer’s Needs & Priorities  **
    *   Partners can complete a customer solution with additional products and services
*   **Give to Get (LevelUp coming)**
    *   Bring Select/Open partners into GitLab opportunities
    *   Ask them about opportunities they may have for GitLab
*   **Collaborate with Partners in your Region (LevelUp coming)**
    *   Treat them as an extension of your team
    *   Plan with key partners in your region
    *   Communicate regularly with them around sales opportunities and pipelines
    *   Help keep GitLab top of mind with them.  Educate them on GitLab.
*   **If misalignments or escalations arise during deal pursuits**
    *   Contact the CAM
    *   Chat with your peers that have channel co-selling experience
    *   Escalate to your manager 
    *   No customer collisions: Strive to stay aligned \
on customer calls - take differing POVs offline

*  **GitLab Direction (Material - Handbook - 5 Minutes)**
   - Our vision is to replace disparate DevOps toolchains with a single application that is pre-configured to work by default across the entire DevOps lifecycle. We aim to make it faster and easier for groups of contributors to deliver value to their users, and we achieve this by enabling: Faster cycle time, driving an improved time to innovation, Easier workflows driving increased collaboration and productivity. Our solution plays well with others, works for teams of any size and composition and for any kind of project, and provides ongoing actionable feedback for continuous improvement. You can read more about the principles that guide our prioritization process in our [product direction handbook.](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#single-application)
*  **Product Maturity (Material - Handbook - 5 Minutes)**
   - GitLab has a broad scope and vision, and we are constantly iterating on existing and new features. Some stages and features are more mature than others. To convey the state of our feature set and be transparent, we have developed a [maturity framework](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/) for categories, application types, and stages.
*  **Use Cases (Material - Handbook - 5 Minutes)**
   - A [customer use case](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/use-cases/) is: A customer problem or initiative that needs a solution and attracts budget. Defined In customer terms: Often aligned to industry analyst market coverage (i.e. Gartner, Forrester, etc. write reports on the topic) These are discrete problems that we believe GitLab solves and are reasons customers choose GitLab (hence which we should seek out in prospects)

### Competitive Advantages & Strategy

*  **Competitor Overview (Material - Handbook - 30 Minutes)**
   - There are a lot of [DevOps tools](https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/) out there.
As a single application for the entire DevOps life cycle, GitLab can remove the pain of having to choose, integrate, learn, and maintain the multitude of tools necessary for a successful DevOps tool chain.
However, GitLab does not claim to contain all the functionality of all the tools listed here.
Click on a DevOps tool to compare it to GitLab.

## Channel Sales Enablement - Advanced Curriculum

### Technical Deep Dive 

* **Auto DevOps**
   - Auto DevOps provides pre-defined CI/CD configuration which allows you to automatically detect, build, test, deploy, and monitor your applications.
Leveraging CI/CD best practices and tools, Auto DevOps aims to simplify the setup and execution of a mature & modern software development lifecycle.
[Review this document](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/) to learn about each component of GitLab Auto DevOps.
* **GitLab API**
   - [Review this document](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html) to learn more about GitLab API, its capabilities and shortcomings.
* **GitLab for Agile**
   - Agile development is iterative, incremental, and lean approaches to streamline and accelerate the delivery of projects.
Ever wondered if GitLab supports Agile methodology?
If you're considering using GitLab it might not be obvious how its features correspond with Agile artifacts, so we've broken it down for you in a [blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/03/05/gitlab-for-agile-software-development/) and the [GitLab Agile Planning page](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/agile-delivery/).
* **GitLab Runners**
   - [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) is the open source project that is used to run your jobs and send the results back to GitLab.
It is used in conjunction with GitLab CI, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab that coordinates the jobs.
Below are slides, the video presentation, and additional information about GitLab Runners.
* **GitLab High Availability (HA) and GitLab GEO**
   - [Review the GitLab Reference Architectures Overview](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/), then hear Brian Wald, Solution Architect Manager, break it all down [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/fji7nvmOHNQ).

### Integrations 

* **Category Overview**
   - GitLab's vision is to be the best single application for every part of the DevOps toolchain.
However, some customers use tools other than our built-in features–and we respect those decisions.
The Integrations category was created specifically to better serve those customers.
Currently, GitLab offers [30+ project services](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/project_services.html#project-services) that integrate with a variety of external systems.
Integrations are a high priority for GitLab, and the Integrations category was established to develop and maintain these integrations with key 3rd party systems and services.
* **Jira** 
   - GitLab Issues are a powerful tool for discussing ideas and planning and tracking work.
However, many organizations have been using Jira for these purposes and have extensive data and business processes built into it.
While you can always migrate content and process from Jira to GitLab Issues, you can also opt to continue using Jira and use it together with GitLab through our [integration.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/jira.html)
For a video demonstration of integration with Jira, watch [GitLab workflow with Jira issues and Jenkins pipelines.](https://youtu.be/Jn-_fyra7xQ)
* **Jenkins**
   - GitLab’s [Jenkins integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jenkins.html) allows you to trigger a Jenkins build when you push code to a repository, or when a merge request is created.
Additionally, it shows the pipeline status on merge request widgets and on the project’s home page.
Videos are also available on [GitLab workflow with Jira issues and Jenkins pipelines](https://youtu.be/Jn-_fyra7xQ) and [Migrating from Jenkins to GitLab.](https://youtu.be/RlEVGOpYF5Y)
* **Github**
   - GitLab provides an integration for updating the pipeline statuses on GitHub.
This is especially useful if using GitLab for CI/CD only.
This project integration is separate from the [instance wide GitHub integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html#mirroring-and-pipeline-status-sharing) and is automatically configured on [GitHub import.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/github.html)

#  Channel Operations

##  Channel Neutral

To incentivize working with our Channel partners, 'Channel Neutral' means that we will not reduce $ value to individual sellers even if the Channel business reduces total iACV to GitLab (via disocunts or rebates).
More information can be found on the [compensation page](/handbook/sales/commissions/#channel-neutral-compensation).

##  Definitions

**Program Compliance**
- For partners to transact, they must join the GitLab Partner Program via the partner portal.
- Non Contracted partners may transact on a one-off basis, only with approval of channel leadership.

**PIO - Partner Initiated Opportunity**
- Any opportunity that was brought to GitLab via a Deal Registration.
- The opportunity must be new to our sales team, and can be for a new or existing customer.
- This is an upfront discount and is dependent on the partners track within the GitLab Partner Program.

**Channel Assist Opportunity**
- Any opportunity where the partner assists our sales team to close the deal.
- This may be a customer demo, an executive introduction meeting, delivery of services, etc.
- This would be a Deal Registration, but for a GitLab sourced opportunity, so it does not qualify for PIO.
- The determination of Channel Assist is at the sales rep determination and tracked via SFDC opportunities.

**Channel Fulfill Opportunity**
- Any opportunity that was fulfilled by a partner but closed independently via the GitLab sales team.
- The partner has only processed the order and didn’t provide any meaningful support to close the deal.

**Services Attach**
- Any partner delivered services that are provided to the end user in support of a GitLab deployment.
- This will result in a 2.5% upfront discount from the product.
- This is stackable for up to three (3) independent services provided by the partner to a single end user.
- This will be administered as an upfront discount from the GitLab license price on the initial sale.
- The partner may sell their own services, after the initial sale, for a rebate of 2.5% of the Net license price for a period of up to nine (9) months.
- The maximum is 7.5% discount or rebate with any combination of upfront or post sales of partner branded services.
- Services may be delivered by a non-Authorized service partner, which will be paid as a referral fee.
- Rebates and referral fees may require CRO approval.

**Services Resale**
- Any partner that resales services that will be delivered by the GitLab Professional Services team.

**Channel Neutral Comp**
- For FY21 the sales team will not absorb any channel partners standard contractual discounts.
- They will be compensated at the non-channel net value of the deal.

**Incumbency Renewal Policy**
- If a partner transacts IACV, when renewal time comes, the partner will own that renewal unless formally communicated by the customer.
- The partner will be required to be program compliant (ie in good credit standing, have provided quarterly updates on customer, review within 30 days of renewal, etc).

## Channels groups, projects, and labels

**Groups**
Use the GitLab.com group for epics that may include issues within and outside the Channels Team group. 
- https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1508300?label_name[]=Channel

- Guidelines for  Partner Folders:  
  - The partners Group is further divided into regional sub-groups
  - Within each region sub-group Partners will get their own group
  - Partner groups contain a collaboration project and internal project
  - Partner employees should be explicitly invited to collaboration group
  - Internal group should not be visible to non-GitLab employees and may contain licensing details or other sensitive information
  - Additional projects may be created within the partner subgroup to contain code bases for prototypes or PoV
  - Please avoid creating additional subgroups within partner groups 

**Projects**
- Create issues under the “Channels” project

**Epics**
- From FY21 Q3 - OKRs will be formed as EPICs and issues related to that Epic should be associated 
- Broad initiatives will have EPICs with several issues to support that project 

**Labels**
  - **Team labels**
      - Channel- issue initially created, used in templates, the starting point for any label that involves Channels

   - **Priority Weighting (using Eisenhower matrix and weighted tabs in Gitlab)** 
      - WEIGHT 1 ~ Channel Priority:1 - Home runs (high value to GitLab and high likelihood of success that align to Sales & Channel OKRs) and committed to completion within stated milestones. This category will be limited because not everything can be a priority.  These are both URGENT & IMPORTANT 
      - WEIGHT 2 ~ Channel Priority:2 - Big Bets (high value to GitLab, lower time urgency, longer dependencies or lower likelihood of success) within stated milestones.  These are not urgent but IMPORTANT to our success
      - WEIGHT 3 - Channel Priority:3 - Small wins within stated milestones.  These are URGENT but not strategically important.  Delegate or push out 
      - WEIGHT 4 - Channel Priority:4 - Small wins that are important but high value.  Should be slotted in where backlog allows 
      - WEIGHT 5 - Channel Priority:Backlog - Things in the queue not currently being worked LABEL
