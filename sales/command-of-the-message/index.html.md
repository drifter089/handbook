## Overview

GitLab has adopted and operationalized Force Management's Command of the Message value-based sales messaging methodology. Due to IP constraints, we have migrated content from this page to a private [Command of the Message Resource Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wwNZCkbEv4-WXm8WQmgR6LKjSgxyLZ-wg-Rp9Qav0Zw/edit?usp=sharing) (**GitLab internal only**). 

## Customer Value Drivers

Value drivers describe what organizations are likely proactively looking for or needing and are top-of-mind customer topics that exist even if GitLab doesnâ€™t. Value drivers may cause buyers to re-allocate discretionary funds, and they support a value-based customer conversation. Organizations adopt and implement GitLab for the following value drivers:
1.  **Increase Operational Efficiencies** - _simplify the software development toolchain to reduce total cost of ownership_
1.  **Deliver Better Products Faster** - _accelerate the software delivery process to meet business objectives_
1.  **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk** - _simplify processes to comply with internal processes, controls and industry regulations without compromising speed_
