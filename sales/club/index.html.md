# Overview

President’s Club is synonymous with excellence and rewards individuals for achieving specific goals. This event aligns with our values of Collaboration and Results which helps to attract high-performing Sales Reps and other roles that support the sales efforts and allow the company to grow at the expected rate. At GitLab, this reward is in the form of an incentive trip to celebrate the success of our top Field Sales Professionals and others in the organization who helped support the team throughout the year.
