# Rules of Engagement (ROE) for Selling GitLab or Partner Professional Services


# Objective

Define when and how a GitLab seller engages with GitLab PS or a GitLab partner for delivering professional services that support customer licensing opportunities and customer success.


# Important to services note

Please remember that as you evaluate your customer/prospect’s needs and build an understanding of their requirements a key success factor will be if the customer/prospect needs services.  The earlier identify and address your customer/prospect/s needs and requirements for services the quicker your licensing opportunity will close.  


# Key Takeaways



1. If the customer already has a services partner that they or you are working with for the customer’s DevOps/GitLab solutions, then start by engaging with that partner to see if they can deliver against the customer's needs.
2. For Large & Mid-Market customers, if the answer to 1 is “there is no partner,” then GitLab Professional Services has first right of refusal for professional services needs & outcomes.  Follow the Professional Services process and GitLab Professional Services will support the customer’s needs or they will tell you to identify and engage a partner.
3. ALL SMB needs will leverage Channel service provider partners.

If you have experience with a fitting/qualified GitLab partner, contact the partner directly.  When briefing or following up with the partner, please CC the partner’s Channel Account Manager (CAM info can be found in SFDC in the Account record for the partner) so that they can support your efforts.
