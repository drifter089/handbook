## SKO 2021 FAQ 
**Q: What are the dates and location?**

A: Sales Kick Off (SKO) will take place virtually from 08-Feb through 12-Feb, 2021. 

**Q: Why are we having a virtual event versus an in-person SKO?**

A: The health and safety of our team is our absolute top priority. Sales leadership closely monitored the global health and travel impacts of COVID-19, and, after a lot of careful consideration, made the decision to shift our  2021 SKO to a fully virtual event. We are confident that this is the best and safest decision for the team. 

**Q: Will we still have an in-person Sales event in 2021?** 

A: Due to the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are currently no plans for an in-person Sales event in 2021. Sales leadership is actively monitoring the COVID-19 crisis and consulting with our security vendor with the health and safety of our team members as our top priority. Sales leadership will update the team in 2021 should this decision change. 

**Q: What platform(s) are we using for the virtual event?**

A: Please stay tuned for more information on our virtual event platform! 

**Q: When and how should I register?**

A: The SKO core team will reach out with more information and update this page with registration details once they are available.  

**Q: What is the agenda?**

A: Please see the section above for a high-level agenda. We will post the final agenda in the event app at a later date. 

Note that we have modified our Virtual SKO agenda so that all content is delivered in half-days. This is to avoid fatigue and respect the fact that team members will have additional committments and responsibilities since they will be at home. 

**Q: Will there be any pre-work?**

A: In support of GitLab’s all-remote culture, there will be pre-work that all SKO participants will be asked to complete to make the best use of our time together in person. Details will be shared in early Q4. 

**Q: What will I be expected to participate in?**

A: SKO is a rare opportunity for our team to come together (even virtually) and prepare for the year ahead. As such, the agenda is purposely crafted with numerous activities to learn, network, and celebrate together, and we kindly ask and expect that every SKO attendee participates in all that SKO has to offer. 

**Q: How will we make SKO 2021 exciting even though it's virtual?**

A: The SKO core team is hard at work planning a fun and engaging virtual event. Everything from the virtual platform to the agenda to the event theme is being carefully crafted to ensure that our team feels connected and energized at Virtual SKO 2021.

**Q: Will we still have an Awards Dinner and networking time?**

A: Rather than an Awards Dinner, we will host an Awards Ceremony on Wednesday. The SKO core team is planning fun and creative ways to ensure 2021 Sales Awards winners are celebrated. We have also built networking time into the agenda each day to give team members time to connect across the organization and with partners.

**Q: How will we include partners in SKO 2021?**

A: We will host a Partner Summit in tandem with SKO. Partners will be invited to participate in our Day 1 keynotes on Tuesday, and they will have their own Partner Summit-specific sessions on Wednesday. Partners will be available to virtually meet and greet with GitLab team members in the virtual Partner Booths each day of SKO after the half-day keynotes or breakout sessions have concluded.

**Q: Where can I ask questions related to SKO?**

A: Please Slack #sko-virtual-2021 or you can email sales-events at gitlab dot com with questions. Members of the core SKO planning team, including Emily Kyle, David Somers and Monica Jacob are actively monitoring this email and will respond to your inquiry as soon as possible. 

We are actively planning this event and will update this FAQ as more information becomes available.
