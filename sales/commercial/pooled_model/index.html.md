## Pooled Model

All members of the Sales, Support, Billing and Deal Desk teams should familiarize themselves with the AMER and EMEA Pooled Models.  

The AMER model leverages team-level account alignment so Pooled SMB customers have a team of AEâ€™s to assist them.  Every AE on the Pooled Account Team is equipped to work with any Pooled customer as the sales point of contact.

The CARR threshold for Pooled accounts is <$4k for existing customers, and <$2k for new customer.

In EMEA, each Pooled AE operates in their own, region specific Pool, 

## Account Ownership

All AMER Pooled Accounts are owned by the [Pooled Sales User](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0058X00000F1YFq?noredirect=1&isUserEntityOverride=1).  Note that these accounts are closely monitored and should not be considered ownerless.

All EMEA Pooled Accounts are owned by that regions Pooled AE.

## Opportunity Ownership

All AMER Pooled Opportunities are owned by the [Pooled Sales User](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0058X00000F1YFq?noredirect=1&isUserEntityOverride=1).  Note that these opps are worked as and when required by the Pooled AEs, and should not be considered ownerless.

All EMEA Pooled Opportunities are owned by that regions Pooled AE.

## Engaging with Pooled Accounts

In AMER, since all Pooled Accounts are owned by the Pooled Sales User, Pooled AEs will only engage with these customers when any of the below scenarios are triggered, and will engage through the subsequent case that is created.

In EMEA, Pooled AEs are free to engage with any customer at any tie, however cases will also be created based on the below triggers.  The AEs will focus on resolving these cases first, before engaging with other customers. 

Triggers are split into 3 categories based on the scenario type. 

- RT: Reactive Trigger. Due to a GitLab internal challege, the customer will need sales assistance in order to transact.
- PRO: Proactive Trigger.  Due to customer behavior/ insight, the customer would likely benefit from a conversation with sales.  There is likely to be an opportunity for growth, or to mitigate churn.  
- HR: Hand Raise. The customer has notified us that they require sales assistance. 

### RT: Failed Auto Renewals

These customers think that there subscription will auto renew, however due to internal challenges, it will not.  

#### Process

Every month, the Product team identifies auto renewal opps that are destined to fail.
Once identified, the *Auto Renewal Status* field on these renewal opportunities is updated.  Full info can be found [here](https://gitlab.highspot.com/items/62defca03bbd437fa8d1e1f1?lfrm=srp.0). 
Once these renewal opps are updated, cases are created so that the Pooled AEs can reach out to the affected customers.  

These cases are expected to enter the Pooled Sales Team Case Queue at least 30 days before the opp close date. 
Once these cases enter the queue, they should be picked up on a first in first out basis.  
Should the AE need to adjust the close date, add notes, create a new quote on the opp in question, they are free to do so.  
Once resolved, the case and the opp should be closed by the AE.

#### Policy

Once cases are created based on *auto renewal opps that are due to fail*, an AE should pick up the case on a first in first out basis.  The oldest open case in the queue should always be picked up first, regardless of the case subject. 
Once the case is resolved, and the opp is set to to closed won, credit will fall under the Pooled Sales User

    - This Case will now drop into the **Pooled Sales Queue**, and will be actioned by a Pooled AE.

### How Pooled AEs work Cases

- If a Pooled AE has capacity, they will click on an open case in the AMER or EMEA Pooled Sales Team Queue and assign it to themselves, by changing the **Case Owner**.
- Based on the email address entered during case creation, the Contact and Account will be automatically populated on the case. If there is no match, the Pooled AE should manually add in the customer Contact. This will then auto populate the Account field.
- Information pertaining to the case will be displated in the **Description** box.
- Once assigned to a Pooled AE, the **Status** should be set to **In Progress**. This will also update the **Date/ Time First Responded** and **Time to First Response** fields.
- The **Case Reason** should be updated based on the nature of the customer's request. If the case owner is unsure of what **Case Reason** to select, they can refer to this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1cWuGo4XCAQmzMBcfUjF7Emr2undkz1ufcUFt4HKmIns/edit).
- To work the case, the Pooled AE should contact the customer, adding activities to the case, and relating them to any applicalbe renewal opportunity. They are also able to update the **Notes** field on the case,
- Once a Case is considered resolved, the **Status** should be set to one of the four Closed options, and the **Resolution Action** updated. This will automatically update the **Date/ Time Closed** field.
- If applicable, the related opportunity should also be closed. 
- At any time, a Pooled AE can view their cases by navigating to the **My Cases** list view in Salesforce.
- Since these cases are to be worked on a reactive basis, and are deemed low priority, the below follow up cadence should be followed.  

| *Day 1* | *Day 3* | *Day 5*| *Day 7*        | 
|----------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Email          | Call | Email   | Email      | 

- A Pooled AE should look to resolve/ close a case within 7 days of it being opened. 

### Ultimate Upgrade Opportunities (AMER)

Even though all AMER Accounts/ Opportunities are owned by the Pooled Sales User, there is one exception where an opp could be AE owned.

- After working a case, should an AE identify an Ultimate Upgrade opp, they are permitted to create and own an upgrade opportunity. (_Ultimate Upgrade_ should be annotated in the _Next Steps_ and _Opportunity Name_)
- Since the AMER Pooled AEs focus on workinG cases, they are only permitted to own 15 active Upgrade opportunities at any one time.
- If a case enters the queue, and the active Upgrade opportunity lives on the same account, the case should be transferred to the AE that is working the Upgrade opp.
- The AMER Pooled ASM will monitor these Upgrade opportunities, and is free to close them out should they not be deemed valid.
- These Ultimate Upgrade opps are tracked on this [dashboard](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/01ZPL0000005I4L).
