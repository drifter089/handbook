## Overview 
Welcome to the Enterprise Sales handbook page!

The Enterprise Sales department is part of [GitLab Sales](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/#welcome-to-the-sales-team-homepage). The sales field in Enterprise is made up of [Strategic Account Leaders (SALs)](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/strategic-account-leader/) who work across functions deliver maximum value to strategic and large prospects and customers throughout their entire journey with GitLab.

Besides this page, there are a few bookmarks you’ll want to set that will be your main sources of truth during your everyday work. These are:

- [The GitLab Sales handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/#welcome-to-the-sales-team-homepage): This page serves as our home base. From here, you can find a wealth of resources that are relevant to the entire sales field. Whether you’re looking for sales order processing info, or wondering how to get executive support, this is where you’ll find what you need.
- [Field Slack Channels](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-google-groups/#field-slack-channels): View and join these Slack channels based on your role and team to stay connected with your peers.
- [The SAL learning hub](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/strategic-account-leaders): You’ll receive access to EdCast during your first week.

## The SAL playbook

Use it as a guide to understand the basics of what key activities and collaboration points are required for things to run smoothly in your territory.
