## Purpose

Ask Me Anything (AMA) meetings are arranged to allow team members the opportunity to learn from and ask questions of our [E-Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#e-group), [Board of Directors](/handbook/board-meetings/#board-of-directors), and others groups who would like to host an AMA on a specific topic. AMAs can be arranged for many purposes, including the following:

- Allow team members to meet new leaders joining the company
- Clarify a company-wide initiative or change that requires more discussion
- Allow team members to learn more about current leaders
- Spark insightful discussions
- Initiate a retrospective discussion

### Who's Involved

AMA meetings typically include the whole company, and are usually hosted by a leader, team member, or a group of leaders.

They can be hosted by anyone who wants to host an AMA, but typically are hosted by one of the following:

- [GitLab E-Group Member](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/?department=executive)
- Director + Leaders
- [Board Member](/handbook/board-meetings/#board-of-directors)
- [GitLab TMRG group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/)

Occasionally an AMA might be held for a smaller audience. It is encouraged for all AMAs to be open to the full company whenever possible. Occasionally an AMA may not make sense to be sent to the whole company. In those instances, it is still encouraged to add the calendar invitation to the GitLab Team Meetings Calendar as sometimes team members may want to join a call that may not be directly directly applicable to them. Whenever creating an AMA for a smaller group, be sure to invite the team directly in the calendar invite.

### Process for initiating a Reverse AMA 

#### E-Group Initiated

- If an E-Group team member would like a Reverse AMA, they or their EBA will contact an associated TMRG. If there isn't an associated TMRG the E-Group member or EBA will broadcast a message through their Slack channel to see if there is a population of members for the AMA. 
- The E-Group member or EBA will create an issue (template to follow) tagging the [TMRG Leads](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/#how-to-join-current-tmrgs-and-their-slack-channels) or a nominated facilitator for a non-tmrg AMA (facilitator group to be determined), a [DIB Team Member](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CLLDY3L8P/p1617863963093900), and Stella Treas (Chief of Staff)
- The TMRG Leads will consult with the TMRG membership and accept or reject the request. If accepted the TMRG leads will provide an ideal timeframe for the AMA, ideally within 4 weeks from the date of the request.  
- Once accepted the EBA will provide a series of times that are suitable
- The E-Group member or EBA will ensure that there is a a Reverse AMA facilitator for the session. (Guidance to follow)
- The EBA will create a calendar invite and Agenda for the agreed time

#### Team Member Initiated

- A team member of a particular underrepresented group will create an issue (Template link to follow)
- The team member will tag a [DIB Team Member](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CLLDY3L8P/p1617863963093900), the [E-Group Members EBA](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/eba/) and Stella Treas (Chief of Staff)
- The E-Group member will review the request, the E-Group member can suggest an alternative member including a direct report to host the AMA or may reject the AMA based on the information provided in the issue.
- If accepted the E-Group EBA will work with the E-Group member or direct report to find a time and date that is sutiable.
- The team member will work the EBA to ensure an agenda and facilitator are in place. 

#### Reverse AMA Facilitators
It is near impossible to be an effective facilitator while also being a participant.  So if you have been identified as a facilitator but would rather participate in the conversation, we encourage you to ask one of your designated facilitator team members (list tbc) to take your place.

- Complete the [Linkedin Learning Facilitator Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/meeting-facilitation/)
- Watch the purpose of Reverse AMA's Video (too come)

**Things to remember:** 

- Remain impartial 
- Ensure the call stays on track 
- Keep a track of time 
- Ensure that a number of voices are heard, including agenda points


#### Scheduling an Reverse AMA

AMAs are generally coordinated, scheduled, and planned by the [Executive Business Administrator](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/eba/) team when an E-Group member is the host. Anytime that an AMA is to be hosted by an executive, VP, or Director at GitLab, it should be arranged and scheduled by that functions EBA. AMAs of Board Members are scheduled by the Staff EBA to the CEO.

Other non-Executive AMAs are scheduled by the [People Operations](/handbook/people-group/#people-experience-vs-people-operations-core-responsibilities--response-timeline) team. These AMAs are typically a result of a change that impacts the company as a whole and may often be hosted by multiple leadership members in the company. Whenever there is an open slot in the Group Conversation calendar, the People Operations Team will reach out to the EBA team to create an AMA.

When scheduling an AMA, be mindful of timezones.  Generally it is best to have two AMAs, one for the Americas/EMEA time zone, and one for the APAC time zones.

### Setup

AMA meetings always start with an [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-wrI4GB8N74O5AUmdnj916uhCbrL2adM8wbD_unrbac/edit?usp=sharing). Ensure that the agenda document is added to the calendar invite at the initial time it is sent to allow everyone to be involved. All questions and answers should be documented in the agenda to allow those who can not attend to catch up as well as to avoid team members talking over each other.

Whenever possible AMAs should be private or publicly [live streamed](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/#live-streaming). Please strive to remain [public by default](/handbook/values/#public-by-default) when hosting an AMA unless it is centered around a topic that is [not-public](/handbook/values/#not-public)

## Reverse Ask Me Anything 

The Reverse AMA format was launched in Sales with our [Black](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/#definitions) team members. We wanted to start with this with Black team members to show support and to stand in solidarity, in response to domestic events in the US, and globally. One of our core [values](/handbook/values/) is DIB (Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging), and part of embracing that value means being better [allies](/handbook/communication/ally-resources/). These can be scheduled to facilitate meaningful conversations with any underrepresented group.
