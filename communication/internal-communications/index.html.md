## Why do we need Internal Comms


### When do you need to engage the Internal Communication Team?

Things to think about: 

1. **What do you need to communicate?** Think about importance and urgency, whether it's business as usual or if you have a call-to-action. 
1. **How many team members does this impact?** Generally the higher the number of team members impacted, the more likely you are to need Internal Communications help. 
1. **How does this communication fit into the wider company narrative?** Think about the bigger picture, do you have the 'why' of what you are doing? Do you need help to shape this?
1. **Is the subject contentious?** (see guidance on contentious issues below)
1. **What is the likely reaction going to be?** Think back to similar communications. What was the reaction? What does this mean for your internal communications approach?
1. **Is it a complicated, will everyone understand it?** Not everyone does the same job as you, are you able to explain it in simple terms that everyone can understand?
1. **What should the communication plan be?** Is this a one off communication or is it split into phases? 
1. **Do you need guidance on any people or legal aspects to it?** Generally changes that impact people could potentially have legal or employment aspects to it and you may need advice and approval from the People Group and/or Legal.
1. **If in doubt, always reach out!** Slack #internal-communications, or create new issue using [internal-communications-request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/chief-of-staff-team/internal-communications/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=)



## Communicating Change 

Every project is different, and each communication strategy should be tailored to reflect the scope and scale of the change. If your project includes a change with a significant impact on team members, or if the project is running into a lot of resistance, then your strategy should emphasize a more comprehensive communication approach.

### Considerations for a change proposal

1. Consider whether the change 'subject' is [public by default.](/handbook/communication/#not-public) 
1. [Everything should start with a Merge Request](/handbook/communication/#everything-starts-with-a-merge-request) but a [Confidential Issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html), visible only to members of a project with sufficient permissions, may be considered if an issue is contentious (see below).

### Things to include in change proposal 
1. Summary of what you are solving for in simple terms (Address the What, Why, When, Who and How) 
1. Solutions you are considering
1. Current or alternative proposals
1. DRI 
1. Milestones - Development period, Feedback period, Iteration period, Go/No-go decision, proposed implementation date etc
1. Feedback mechanism (an Issue, a Slack channel, an AMA etc)
1. Links and references

### What is a contentious issue?

**A contentious issue is something that:**
- People are likely to disagree or argue with
- Something that is controversial

**What can be contentious? (list not exhaustive):**
1. A decision/policy/issue/subject
1. Feedback
1. An opinion 
1. Wording
1. A meeting
1. A person 

**Examples of potentially contentious topics at GitLab (list not exhaustive):**
1. Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging issues
