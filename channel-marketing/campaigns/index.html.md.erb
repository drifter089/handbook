## What is a Partner Instant Marketing Campaign?

With GitLab Instant Marketing campaign assets, GitLab’s Select and Open partners have access to marketing resources to help them quickly, and easily generate qualified prospects for their sales teams. We’ve developed turnkey, integrated partner campaigns-in-a-box, which we refer to as “Partner Instant Marketing” campaigns, so partners can simply and easily co-brand assets and execute!

These assets leverage GitLab go-to-market motions, such as GitOps and DevOps, but are modified and expanded (in some cases) for partner use. Campaign assets include: nurture emails, landing pages, short videos, mini-books, social media and paid ads, quick sales guides and sales call scripts. All assets can be found on theGitLab partner portal.  

Our modular campaign is designed to be a flexible, self-service model, so partners can download an entire campaign, or a couple of assets, and the materials are customizable and co-brandable. 

For questions about our Instant Marketing campaigns reach out to [Karen Pourshadi](mailto:kpourshadi@gitlab.com).

Here’s a look at our campaigns:

- GitLab Free Trials (May 2021)
- GitLab with GitOps (June 2021)
- GitLab with DevOps (coming soon!)
